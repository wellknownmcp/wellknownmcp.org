But LLM-based agents don't browse — they **reason, act, and collaborate**. They need:\\n\\n- **Semantic context** beyond HTML parsing\\n- **Trust signals** to verify information integrity\\n- **Intent declarations** to understand allowed interactions\\n- **Behavioral guidance** for safe autonomous operation\\n- **Capability discovery** without trial-and-error\\n\\n**LLMFeed bridges this gap** — turning websites from passive content into **active, agent-ready endpoints**.\\n\\n## 🧠 Why Not Just Use Existing Standards?\\n\\n| Standard | Purpose | Limitation for Agents |\\n| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| **HTML + CSS** | Human visual rendering | Agents need semantic meaning, not layout |\\n| **Schema.org** | Content metadata | No trust signals, no behavioral guidance, no agent intent |\\n| **OpenAPI** | API specifications | Technical details only — no trust, intent, or usage context |\\n| **robots.txt** | Crawler permissions | Binary allow/deny — no nuanced agent guidance |\\n| **RSS/Atom** | Content syndication | Content-only — no capabilities, trust, or interaction logic |\\n\\n**LLMFeed is different**: it combines **meaning** (what is this?), **trust** (who vouches for it?), **intent** (what should agents do?), and **action** (how to interact safely?) in a single, verifiable format.\\n\\n## 🛠️ Minimum Structure\\n\\nAll valid feeds must include these two top-level blocks:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"export\\\",\\n \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n \\\"origin\\\": \\\"https://example.org\\\",\\n \\\"title\\\": \\\"Sample Page\\\",\\n \\\"generated_at\\\": \\\"2025-05-20T15:00:00Z\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAdditional blocks are context-specific: `data`, `intent`, `trust`, `capabilities`, `prompts`, `session_state`, `credential`, etc.\\n\\n## 🧱 Standard Block Types\\n\\n| Block | Purpose | Agent Value |\\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\\n| `feed_type` | Defines what kind of feed this is | Routing logic |\\n| `metadata` | Describes title, origin, timestamp, etc. | Provenance & context |\\n| `trust` | Indicates signed blocks, trust scope | **Verification & safety** |\\n| `signature` | Cryptographic proof of authenticity | **Anti-tampering** |\\n| `certification` | Third-party attestation (e.g., LLMCA) | **Elevated trust scoring** |\\n| `data` | Carries exportable content (HTML, bundle, etc.) | Structured content |\\n| `intent` | Declares purpose and expected interactions | **Agent behavior guidance** |\\n| `audience` | Target consumers (e.g., `llm`, `developer`) | **Audience filtering** |\\n| `agent_guidance` | Soft behavioral hints for agents | **Interaction style** |\\n| `capabilities` | Callable functions or API endpoints | **Action discovery** |\\n\\n→ **[Complete Block Reference](./llmfeed_block-reference.md)**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🟡 PRACTICAL USAGE\\n\\n## 🧹 Common Feed Types & Real-World Examples\\n\\n| Feed Type | Use Case | Real Example |\\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `mcp` | Describe your service/site | **Healthcare**: France Care symptom triage |\\n| `export` | Share a page's content with agents | **E-commerce**: Product data with verified pricing |\\n| `prompt` | Structure prompts for reuse | **Education**: Certified tutoring prompts |\\n| `session` | Reconstruct LLM session context | **Support**: Conversation replay for handoff |\\n| `credential` | Share API credentials or access claims | **IoT**: Device authentication tokens |\\n| `pricing` | Describe monetization model | **SaaS**: API usage costs for agents |\\n| `capabilities` | Expose agent-callable functions | **Booking**: Restaurant reservation API |\\n\\n→ **[Complete Feed Types](../02_feedtypes/)** | **[Live Examples](https://wellknownmcp.org/ecosystem)**\\n\\n## 🌐 The LLMFeed Ecosystem\\n\\nLLMFeed isn't just a format — it's supported by a complete trust and tooling ecosystem:\\n\\n- **[wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org/)**: Open specification and reference implementation\\n- **[llmca.org](https://llmca.org/)**: Certification Authority for trusted signatures and verification\\n- **[llmfeedforge.org](https://llmfeedforge.org/)**: Interactive tools for creating, testing, and validating feeds\\n\\nThis distributed architecture ensures **no single point of control** while providing **verifiable trust** through cryptographic signatures and independent certification.\\n\\n## 🔐 Trust & Verification: The Game Changer\\n\\nUnlike traditional web metadata, LLMFeed enables **cryptographic verification**:\\n\\n### Trust Block\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"trust\\\": {\\n \\\"signed_blocks\\\": [\\\"feed_type\\\", \\\"metadata\\\", \\\"trust\\\", \\\"data\\\"],\\n \\\"scope\\\": \\\"public\\\",\\n \\\"certifier\\\": \\\"https://llmca.org\\\",\\n \\\"public_key_hint\\\": \\\"https://llmca.org/.well-known/public.pem\\\",\\n \\\"algorithm\\\": \\\"ed25519\\\",\\n \\\"hints\\\": \\\"critical context integrity\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Signature Block\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"signature\\\": {\\n \\\"value\\\": \\\"abc123...\\\",\\n \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2025-06-01T12:34:56Z\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Why this matters**: Agents can verify that content hasn't been tampered with, trace the source of information, and make trust-based decisions about which data to use or actions to perform.\\n\\n## 💡 Getting Started\\n\\n1. **Explore examples** at [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org/)\\n2. **Generate your first feed** with [LLMFeedForge](https://llmfeedforge.org/)\\n3. **Publish to `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`** on your domain\\n4. **Test with your favorite LLM** — most already understand the format\\n5. **Consider certification** via [LLMCA](https://llmca.org/) for enhanced trust\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🔵 ADVANCED TOPICS\\n\\n## 🤖 Agent Behavior & Guidance\\n\\nLLMFeed goes beyond data description to **shape how agents interact**:\\n\\n### Agent Guidance Example\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"agent_guidance\\\": {\\n \\\"interaction_tone\\\": \\\"professional\\\",\\n \\\"consent_hint\\\": \\\"Ask user before accessing sensitive health data\\\",\\n \\\"risk_tolerance\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n \\\"fallback_behavior\\\": \\\"escalate to human support\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Capability Declaration\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"capabilities\\\": [\\n {\\n \\\"name\\\": \\\"bookAppointment\\\",\\n \\\"method\\\": \\\"POST\\\",\\n \\\"path\\\": \\\"/api/booking\\\",\\n \\\"requires_user_consent\\\": true,\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Book medical consultation with verified practitioner\\\"\\n }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThis enables **safe autonomous operation** — agents know what they can do, what requires human confirmation, and how to behave appropriately.\\n\\n## 🎯 From Copy-Paste to Agent Workflows\\n\\nLLMFeed enables what we call **\\\"copy-paste on steroids\\\"**:\\n\\n- **Traditional copy-paste**: Unstructured text with lost context\\n- **LLMFeed export**: Signed, contextualized data that preserves meaning, source, and usage guidelines\\n\\n**Use cases:**\\n\\n- **Cross-agent collaboration**: Agent A processes data, exports signed result for Agent B\\n- **Session continuity**: Replay conversations with full context preservation\\n- **Verified content sharing**: Share quotes, data, or analysis with cryptographic provenance\\n- **Workflow automation**: Agents discover and chain capabilities across services\\n\\nThe **ExportToLLM** pattern turns any webpage into an agent-ready capsule with one click.\\n\\n## 🚀 Lifecycle & Integration\\n\\n1. **Generate**: Created by humans, scripts, or agents themselves\\n2. **Sign**: Optionally cryptographically signed for verification\\n3. **Certify**: Third-party validation by trusted authorities\\n4. **Publish**: Served from `.well-known/` directories or APIs\\n5. **Discover**: Agents find and parse feeds for decision-making\\n6. **Act**: Triggers behaviors, API calls, or collaborative workflows\\n7. **Verify**: Ongoing validation and trust scoring\\n\\n## 📤 Export and Portable Intelligence\\n\\nBeyond serving feeds to crawlers, `.llmfeed.json` files are **intelligence capsules**:\\n\\n- **Portable knowledge blocks** that maintain context across platforms\\n- **Contextual copy/paste actions** for LLM interfaces\\n- **Verified content sharing** between applications\\n- **Traceability and attribution** through cryptographic signatures\\n\\n## 🤝 MCP and OpenAPI: Better Together\\n\\nLLMFeed doesn't replace OpenAPI — it **enhances** it:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"capabilities\\\": [\\n {\\n \\\"type\\\": \\\"endpoint\\\",\\n \\\"intent\\\": \\\"get status\\\",\\n \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://api.example.com/status\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Check service health with verified uptime data\\\"\\n },\\n {\\n \\\"type\\\": \\\"openapi\\\", \\n \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://example.com/.well-known/openapi.json\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Complete technical API specification\\\"\\n }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n**The hybrid approach**:\\n\\n- **MCP provides**: Intent, trust, agent guidance, and behavioral context\\n- **OpenAPI provides**: Technical schemas, parameters, and response formats\\n\\n## 🗺️ Explore the Full Specification\\n\\n- [`llmfeed_block-reference.md`](./llmfeed_block-reference.md) — Complete block documentation\\n- [`02_feedtypes/`](../02_feedtypes/) — Detailed feed type specifications\\n- [`03_extensions/`](../03_extensions/) — Signatures, trust, and advanced features\\n- [`04_agent-behavior/`](../04_agent-behavior) — Agent interaction guidelines\\n- [`wellknown.md`](./wellknown.md) — Publishing and discovery patterns\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🔮 FUTURE VISION\\n\\n## 🕸️ Beyond the Web: Introducing MCP-Net\\n\\nLLMFeed enables something revolutionary: **complete independence from the traditional web**.\\n\\nWhile `.well-known/` integration bridges the current web to agents, LLMFeed's true potential lies in **pure agent-to-agent communication**:\\n\\n### Direct LLMFeed Navigation\\n\\n```json\\n// Agent requests another agent's capabilities\\nGET /agent/capabilities.llmfeed.json\\n\\n// Agent shares processed data with verification\\nPOST /agent/process -> session.llmfeed.json (signed)\\n\\n// Agent discovers peer services \\nGET /network/index.llmfeed.json -> [list of agent nodes]\\n```\\n\\n### Inter-Agent Protocols\\n\\n- **No HTML rendering** required — agents read structured feeds directly\\n- **Cryptographic verification** at every exchange\\n- **Intent-driven routing** — agents know exactly what other agents can do\\n- **Capability discovery** without browsing or guessing\\n\\n### Inter-Node Communication\\n\\nIn **MCP-Net**, each node (device, service, agent) exposes:\\n\\n- `identity.llmfeed.json` — who/what it is\\n- `capabilities.llmfeed.json` — what it can do\\n- `network.llmfeed.json` — how to reach peers\\n- `session/*.llmfeed.json` — interaction history\\n\\n### The Post-Web Vision\\n\\n```\\nTraditional Web: Human → Browser → HTML → Server\\nMCP-Net: Agent → LLMFeed → Verification → Agent\\n```\\n\\n**Result**: A parallel infrastructure where intelligent agents communicate directly, securely, and semantically — no human-readable interfaces required.\\n\\n## 🌍 Join the Revolution: From Web to MCP-Net\\n\\nLLMFeed is more than a data format — it's **infrastructure for machine intelligence networks**.\\n\\n**Phase 1**: Enhance existing websites with `.well-known/` feeds \\n**Phase 2**: Enable pure agent-to-agent workflows \\n**Phase 3**: Bootstrap **MCP-Net** — a parallel internet for autonomous agents\\n\\nAs agents become ubiquitous, those who master LLMFeed will shape the **post-web era** of machine communication.\\n\\n**The Agentic Web is here. MCP-Net is next.**"

through **predictive quality systems** that:\\n\\n- **Predict defects** before they occur through statistical analysis\\n- **Optimize processes** in real-time based on multi-dimensional data\\n- **Prevent failures** through predictive maintenance and risk modeling\\n- **Ensure consistency** through Six Sigma statistical process control\\n- **Enable automation** through intelligent decision-making systems\\n\\n### **The Agentic Web Needs the Same Revolution**\\n\\nCurrent AI agents make decisions like **pre-industrial craftsmen** — using simple rules and human oversight for quality control.\\n\\n**LLMFeed Risk Scoring** brings **industrial-grade quality control** to autonomous agent decision-making:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"manufacturing_to_agentic\\\": {\\n \\\"statistical_process_control\\\": \\\"real_time_risk_assessment_and_adjustment\\\",\\n \\\"predictive_maintenance\\\": \\\"predictive_failure_prevention_for_agent_workflows\\\", \\n \\\"quality_gates\\\": \\\"automated_go_no_go_decisions_based_on_risk_thresholds\\\",\\n \\\"six_sigma\\\": \\\"99.99966_percent_reliable_agent_decision_making\\\",\\n \\\"total_quality_management\\\": \\\"end_to_end_risk_optimization_across_agent_networks\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*This transforms agents from \\\"sometimes works\\\" to \\\"industrial reliability.\\\"*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔧 Foundation: Basic Risk Assessment (LLMFeed 1.0 - Preserved)\\n\\n### **🎛️ Core Risk Fields (Original Specification)**\\n\\nAgents encounter these fundamental risk indicators:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"risk_score\\\": 0.8,\\n \\\"safety_tier\\\": \\\"high-risk\\\", \\n \\\"flags\\\": [\\\"potentially misleading\\\", \\\"unverified origin\\\"],\\n \\\"confidence_level\\\": 0.65,\\n \\\"last_validation\\\": \\\"2025-06-10T14:30:00Z\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### **🚦 Basic Agent Behavior Rules (Preserved)**\\n\\nAgents **SHOULD** apply this foundational logic:\\n\\n| Field | Threshold | Action |\\n| ------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `risk_score` > 0.7 | Medium Risk | Warn user or restrict critical actions |\\n| `risk_score` > 0.9 | High Risk | REJECT feed or require explicit override |\\n| `safety_tier = high-risk` | Critical | Display warning and restrict sensitive capabilities |\\n| `flags` contains critical flag | Immediate | Highlight, warn, and possibly reject |\\n\\n### **🛠️ Basic Agent Policy Configuration**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"agent_policy\\\": {\\n \\\"max_acceptable_risk_score\\\": 0.7,\\n \\\"reject_on_flags\\\": [\\\"unverified origin\\\", \\\"potentially misleading\\\"],\\n \\\"require_human_approval_above\\\": 0.8,\\n \\\"automatic_fallback_below\\\": 0.3\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### **🧩 UI Risk Propagation (Original Patterns)**\\n\\n- **Risk badges** and color indicators (🟢🟡🔴)\\n- **Risk explanations** in plain language\\n- **Capability gating** based on risk levels\\n- **Progressive disclosure** of risk details\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🏭 Industrial-Grade Multi-Dimensional Risk Assessment\\n\\n### **🎯 The Six Sigma Approach to Agent Risk**\\n\\nManufacturing quality control taught us that **single-point failure detection is insufficient** — you need **multi-dimensional quality assessment** with **predictive capabilities**.\\n\\n#### **The Six Dimensions of Agentic Risk**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"comprehensive_risk_model\\\": {\\n \\\"operational_risk\\\":

Reputation on the Line\\n\\n### Why Sign Your Manifesto?\\n\\nWhen you **sign** your manifesto with a cryptographic signature, you're making a **public commitment**. You're saying: *\\\"This is really what we stand for, and we're willing to stake our reputation on it.\\\"*\\n\\n**Benefits of signing:**\\n\\n- ✅ **Builds trust** — visitors know the values are authentic\\n- ✅ **Prevents tampering** — no one can alter your stated mission\\n- ✅ **Creates accountability** — you're publicly committed to these values\\n- ✅ **Enables verification** — agents can confirm authenticity\\n\\n**The risk:** If you claim values you don't actually follow, the internet will notice.\\n\\n### Consequences of Manifesto Mismatch\\n\\n**Signed manifestos create accountability.** If your stated values don't match your actual behavior:\\n\\n#### Community Flagging\\n\\nUsers and organizations can **flag** your manifesto if they observe:\\n\\n- Values you claim but don't practice\\n- Misleading mission statements\\n- Promises you consistently break\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"flags\\\": [\\n {\\n \\\"type\\\": \\\"values_mismatch\\\",\\n \\\"submitted_by\\\": \\\"Digital Rights Foundation\\\", \\n \\\"reason\\\": \\\"Claims to prioritize privacy but shares data with 47 partners\\\",\\n \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"https://privacy-report.org/yoursite-analysis\\\",\\n \\\"status\\\": \\\"verified\\\"\\n }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n#### Agent Behavior Impact\\n\\nWhen agents encounter **flagged manifestos**, they:\\n\\n- ⚠️ **Lower trust levels** in stated values\\n- 🔍 **Cross-reference claims** with independent sources\\n- 👤 **Prompt users** before taking actions based on claimed values\\n- 📊 **Prefer unflagged alternatives** when available\\n\\n#### Reputation Consequences\\n\\n- **Search rankings** may be affected by persistent flags\\n- **Business partnerships** may review flagged manifestos\\n- **User trust** erodes when promises don't match reality\\n- **Regulatory attention** increases for inconsistent claims\\n\\n### Certification: Third-Party Verification\\n\\nBeyond self-signed manifestos, **trusted third parties** can certify that your stated values match your actual practices.\\n\\n#### Example: B-Corp Certification\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"trust\\\": {\\n \\\"signed_blocks\\\": [\\\"mission\\\", \\\"core_values\\\", \\\"how_we_serve\\\"],\\n \\\"scope\\\": \\\"comprehensive\\\",\\n \\\"certifier\\\": \\\"https://bcorporation.net\\\",\\n \\\"certification_details\\\": {\\n \\\"type\\\": \\\"B-Corporation Certified\\\",\\n \\\"verified_claims\\\": [\\\"environmental_responsibility\\\", \\\"worker_welfare\\\", \\\"community_benefit\\\"],\\n \\\"audit_date\\\": \\\"2025-03-15T00:00:00Z\\\",\\n \\\"next_review\\\": \\\"2026-03-15T00:00:00Z\\\",\\n \\\"score\\\": \\\"94.2/200\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Certification Benefits\\n\\n- 🏆 **Higher agent trust** — certified values carry more weight\\n- ✅ **Verified claims** — third-party audits confirm practices match promises\\n- 🛡️ **Protection from false flags** — certification provides defense against unfounded accusations\\n- 📈 **Competitive advantage** — users prefer verified organizations\\n\\n#### Types of Certifiers\\n\\n- **Industry bodies** (Fair Trade, B-Corp, ISO standards)\\n- **Government agencies** (regulatory compliance verification)\\n- **NGOs** (Digital Rights Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation)\\n- **Professional auditors** (specialized manifesto verification services)\\n\\n### Trust Levels in Practice\\n\\n| Trust Level | Description | Agent Behavior |\\n| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\\n| **Unsigned** | Basic manifesto, no verification | Informational only, low trust weight |\\n| **Self-signed** | Organization commits with signature | Medium trust, cross-reference important claims |\\n| **Certified** | Third-party verified | High trust, use values for decision-making |\\n| **Flagged** | Community reports issues | Cautious approach, prompt user for sensitive actions |\\n\\n### Real-World Example: University Manifesto\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"manifesto\\\",\\n \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n \\\"title\\\": \\\"State University Educational Mission\\\",\\n \\\"origin\\\": \\\"https://stateuniversity.edu\\\"\\n },\\n \\\"mission\\\": {\\n \\\"purpose\\\": \\\"To provide accessible, high-quality education that prepares students for meaningful careers and engaged citizenship\\\"\\n },\\n \\\"core_values\\\": [\\n {\\n \\\"value\\\": \\\"Academic Excellence\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Rigorous programs taught by expert faculty with strong student outcomes\\\"\\n },\\n {\\n \\\"value\\\": \\\"Affordability & Access\\\", \\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Education should not be limited by economic background\\\"\\n }\\n ],\\n \\\"trust\\\": {\\n \\\"signed_blocks\\\": [\\\"mission\\\", \\\"core_values\\\"],\\n \\\"scope\\\": \\\"partial\\\",\\n \\\"certifier\\\": \\\"https://accreditation-board.org\\\",\\n \\\"certification_details\\\": {\\n \\\"type\\\": \\\"Regional Accreditation\\\",\\n \\\"verified_claims\\\": [\\\"academic_standards\\\", \\\"financial_transparency\\\", \\\"student_outcomes\\\"],\\n \\\"accreditation_status\\\": \\\"Fully Accredited\\\",\\n \\\"expires\\\": \\\"2030-06-01T00:00:00Z\\\"\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**If this university:**\\n\\n- ❌ Raises tuition 300% → Community flags \\\"affordability\\\" claim\\n- ❌ Has 15% graduation rate → Accreditation at risk\\n- ✅ Maintains low costs + high outcomes → Certification renewed, high agent trust\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Agent Behavior Recommendations\\n\\n| Scenario | Expected Action |\\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Unsigned manifesto | Display mission/values as informational context |\\n| Signed manifesto | Use values to guide interaction approach with medium trust |\\n| Certified manifesto | Apply values as strong guidance for decisions |\\n| Flagged manifesto | Cross-reference claims, prompt user for verification |\\n| Values conflict with request | Respectfully acknowledge stated values, note any flags |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why This Matters for Agents\\n\\nWhen agents encounter a manifesto, they can:\\n\\n- ✅ **Understand context** — why this site exists\\n- ✅ **Respect values** — interact in ways aligned with stated principles\\n- ✅ **Set expectations** — know what the site is trying to accomplish\\n- ✅ **Communicate better** — frame responses based on the organization's mission\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Tips\\n\\n### For Organizations\\n\\n1. **Be authentic** — write what you actually believe, not what sounds good\\n2. **Be specific** — \\\"we care about people\\\" is less helpful than \\\"we prioritize student success over profit\\\"\\n3. **Be consistent** — make sure your manifesto matches what visitors experience\\n4. **Keep it current** — review annually and update as your mission evolves\\n\\n### For Developers\\n\\n1. **Start simple** — just mission and values is enough to begin\\n2. **Place at standard location** — `/.well-known/manifesto.llmfeed.json`\\n3. **Link from main MCP feed** — reference in your `mcp.llmfeed.json`\\n4. **Consider signing** — builds trust in your stated values\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Integration with Other Feeds\\n\\n- **`mcp.llmfeed.json`** — main feed can reference manifesto for context\\n- **`capabilities.llmfeed.json`** — API descriptions can reflect stated values\\n- **Agent behavior** — other feeds can inherit tone/approach from manifesto\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n### For Site Owners\\n\\n- ✅ Clear communication of purpose and values\\n- ✅ Better agent interactions aligned with your mission\\n- ✅ Transparency builds trust with visitors\\n- ✅ Differentiation from similar sites\\n\\n### For Agents\\n\\n- ✅ Context for how to interact respectfully\\n- ✅ Understanding of site purpose and audience\\n- ✅ Guidance for tone and approach\\n- ✅ Trust signals through verified values\\n\\n### For Users\\n\\n- ✅ Clear understanding of what a site stands for\\n- ✅ Confidence that agents respect organizational values\\n- ✅ Transparency about purpose and intentions\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Related Feed Types\\n\\n- **`mcp.llmfeed.json`**: Main service declaration (may reference manifesto)\\n- **`prompt.llmfeed.json`**: Structured prompts (can include values context)\\n- **Agent guidance patterns**: Behavioral hints that reflect stated values\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis simple but powerful feedtype helps create a more **human, value-aligned agentic web** where sites can clearly communicate their purpose and agents can interact more respectfully and contextually."

offers and how to interact with it safely.\\n\\nThink of it as your site's **\\\"Hello, I speak to agents\\\"** introduction card.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Makes a Site Agent-Ready?\\n\\n**Traditional websites** serve HTML for humans. \\n**Agent-ready websites** also serve structured context for AI.\\n\\nThe `mcp.llmfeed.json` file bridges this gap by declaring:\\n\\n- ✅ **What your site is about**\\n- ✅ **What agents can do here**\\n- ✅ **How to interact safely**\\n- ✅ **What level of trust applies**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Minimum Structure (Hello World)\\n\\n**Your first MCP

Discover that a service exists\\n2. Visit the service website\\n3. Create a developer account\\n4. Generate an API key\\n5. Copy-paste it into agent configuration\\n6. Manage expiration, rotation, permissions...\\n```\\n\\n### **AFTER LLMFeed: Agents Handle Everything**\\n\\n```\\nUser: \\\"I'd like to analyze this document\\\"\\nAgent: \\\"I can do that! I found DocumentAI which looks perfect. \\n Would you like me to access their advanced features?\\\"\\nUser: \\\"Yes\\\"\\nAgent: [Automatically negotiates access, obtains credentials, \\n processes document]\\nAgent: \\\"Here's your complete analysis!\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**The user never saw an API key. The agent managed everything.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔍 The Magic Flow in 4 Steps\\n\\n### **Step 1: Automatic Discovery**\\n\\nThe agent discovers available services via [well-known URIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785):\\n\\n```json\\n// /.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"mcp\\\",\\n \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n \\\"title\\\": \\\"DocumentAI Service\\\",\\n \\\"origin\\\": \\\"https://api.documentai.com\\\"\\n },\\n \\\"capabilities\\\": [\\n {\\n \\\"name\\\": \\\"basic_preview\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Preview document analysis\\\",\\n \\\"auth_required\\\": false\\n },\\n {\\n \\\"name\\\": \\\"full_analysis\\\", \\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Complete AI document processing\\\",\\n \\\"auth_required\\\": true,\\n \\\"user_benefit\\\": \\\"10x more accurate, supports 50+ languages\\\"\\n }\\n ],\\n \\\"auth_flow\\\": {\\n \\\"agent_can_request\\\": true,\\n \\\"user_consent_required\\\": true,\\n \\\"credential_endpoint\\\": \\\"/.well-known/credential.llmfeed.json\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*See [MCP Feed Type](../02_llmfeed_feedtype/llmfeed_feedtype_mcp.md) for complete specification.*\\n\\n### **Step 2: Negotiation with Consent**\\n\\n```\\nAgent: \\\"DocumentAI offers advanced analysis that would be \\n perfect for your document. May I request access?\\\"\\n\\nUser: \\\"Yes, go ahead\\\"\\n\\nAgent: [Follows credential endpoint automatically]\\n```\\n\\n### **Step 3: Autonomous Credential Management**\\n\\nThe agent receives and stores credentials automatically:\\n\\n```json\\n// credential.llmfeed.json (managed by agent)\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"credential\\\",\\n \\\"credential\\\": {\\n \\\"key_hint\\\":

}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*See [Credential Feed Type](../02_llmfeed_feedtype/llmfeed_feedtype_credential.md) for cryptographic security details.*\\n\\n### **Step 4: Transparent Service Access**\\n\\n```json\\n// /.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json?key=dmai_abc123 (automatic)\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"mcp\\\",\\n \\\"capabilities\\\": [\\n { \\\"name\\\": \\\"advanced_ocr\\\",

\\\"authenticated\\\",\\n \\\"key_hint\\\": \\\"dmai_...abc123\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**The agent can now use the service as if it were native.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🌟 What This Changes Fundamentally\\n\\n### **For Users**\\n\\n- ✅ **Zero configuration**: never handle API keys manually\\n- ✅ **Informed consent**: understand what they're authorizing\\n- ✅ **Seamless experience**: agents handle everything behind the scenes\\n- ✅ **Security**: no sensitive keys exposed in interfaces\\n\\n### **For Agents**\\n\\n- ✅ **Automatic discovery**: find relevant services via [well-known discovery](../01_llmfeed/wellknown.md)\\n- ✅ **Autonomous management**: obtain and maintain credentials\\n- ✅ **Dynamic adaptation**: adjust to limits and permissions\\n- ✅ **Error recovery**: handle access issues automatically\\n\\n### **For Service Providers**\\n\\n- ✅ **Simplified acquisition**: agents bring qualified users\\n- ✅ **Smooth onboarding**: agent → paying user conversion\\n- ✅ **Optimized usage**: agents automatically respect limits\\n- ✅ **Verified trust**: signature and certification system\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔧 Authentication Methods (Transparent to Users)\\n\\nAgents automatically handle:\\n\\n### **Bearer Token** (Recommended)\\n\\n```http\\nGET /.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json\\nAuthorization: Bearer dmai_abc123def456\\n```\\n\\n### **API Key Header**\\n\\n```http\\nGET /.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json\\nX-API-Key: dmai_abc123def456\\n```\\n\\n### **URL Parameter** (Fallback)\\n\\n```http\\nGET /.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json?key=dmai_abc123def456\\n```\\n\\n### **Credential POST** (Secure Environments)\\n\\n```http\\nPOST /.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json\\nContent-Type: application/json\\n\\n{\\n \\\"credential\\\": {\\n \\\"key_hint\\\": \\\"dmai_...def456\\\",\\n \\\"signature\\\": \\\"proof_of_possession\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Users never see these technical details.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📱 Mobile App Integration\\n\\nThe same principle applies to mobile applications:\\n\\n```json\\n// /.well-known/mobile-app.llmfeed.json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"mobile-app\\\",\\n \\\"app_integration\\\": {\\n \\\"agent_auth_flow\\\": true,\\n \\\"deep_link_support\\\": \\\"myapp://agent-auth/callback\\\",\\n \\\"credential_sharing\\\":

logging\\\"\\n }\\n ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Result**: Agents can negotiate access to your mobile app and interact via API, without any user configuration.\\n\\n*See [Mobile App Feed Type](../02_llmfeed_feedtype/llmfeed_feedtype_mobile-app.md) for complete mobile integration patterns.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧠 OpenAPI: Best of Both Worlds\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"capabilities\\\": [\\n

with constructive alternatives.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🎯 The Impact: A Truly Agentic Web\\n\\n### **Before**: Web for Humans\\n\\n- Websites for human navigation\\n- APIs for technical developers\\n- Manual configuration required\\n\\n### **After**: Web for Agents\\n\\n- ✅ **Services auto-discoverable** by agents\\n- ✅ **Automatic access negotiation**\\n- ✅ **Transparent credential management**\\n- ✅ **Frictionless user experience**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🛡️ Security & Trust Integration\\n\\nThis extension integrates with LLMFeed's [risk scoring

consent.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📋 Implementation Guidelines\\n\\n### **For Service Providers**\\n\\n1. **Expose discovery endpoints**\\n \\n - Implement `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` for service discovery\\n - Provide `/.well-known/credential.llmfeed.json` for agent authentication\\n\\n2. **Enable agent-friendly flows**\\n \\n - Create agent-specific onboarding processes\\n - Implement

This mechanism lets your users extract structured `.llmfeed.json` representations of a page, app, or interaction context.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔁 Three Export Modes\\n\\nDepending on your architecture and audience, you can implement **three types of feed generation**:\\n\\n### 1. **Static Export**\\n- Uses a predefined `.llmfeed.json` file hosted on the server\\n- Best for tutorials, examples, default templates\\n- Requires no backend logic\\n\\n```html\\n<a href=\\\"/exports/example.llmfeed.json\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">\\n Export Static Feed\\n</a>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Dynamic Export**\\n- The button triggers a backend call (`POST`) with current context or data\\n- The server uses recipes or logic to generate the feed\\n- Ideal for authenticated sessions or role-based output\\n\\n```js\\nasync function exportDynamicFeed() {\\n const res = await fetch('/api/llmfeed/dynamic/my-feed-id', {\\n method: 'POST',\\n body: JSON.stringify({ html: document.documentElement.outerHTML }),\\n headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\n });\\n const feed = await res.json();\\n exportFeed(feed);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Current DOM Export (Client-only)**\\n- Uses the current DOM to build a snapshot\\n- Optionally cleaned before export\\n- Useful in demo tools or embedded UIs\\n\\n```js\\nconst cleanDOM = (root) => {\\n root.querySelectorAll('nav, footer, .share-buttons, [data-llm=\\\"ignore\\\"]').forEach(el => el.remove());\\n return root;\\n};\\n\\nconst html = cleanDOM(document.documentElement.cloneNode(true)).outerHTML;\\n// Then POST or parse this into a feed\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧠 UX Strategies\\n\\nYou have two primary **export UX models**:\\n\\n### 🧾 Tab Download\\n- Opens a new tab with the `.llmfeed.json`\\n- Best for inspection, manual copy, or saving\\n\\n```js\\nconst blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(feed, null, 2)], { type: 'application/json' });\\nconst url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\\nwindow.open(url, '_blank');\\n```\\n\\n### 📋 Clipboard Copy\\n- Ideal for sending directly to an LLM\\n- Requires document focus and permissions\\n\\n```js\\nawait navigator.clipboard.writeText(JSON.stringify(feed, null, 2));\\nalert(\\\"✅ Copied to clipboard\\\");\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✨ Backend: How you generate the feed is up to you\\n\\nYou can use:\\n- A custom route (`/api/llmfeed/dynamic`)\\n- A recipe-style engine (`recipes.js`)\\n- Or an LLM-powered transformer\\n\\nWhat matters is that the feed:\\n- Complies with `.llmfeed.json` schema\\n- Contains a clear `metadata.origin`\\n- Optionally includes `trust.signed_blocks` for signed output\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Recommendation\\n\\n- **For simple cases**: serve static JSON files\\n- **For live apps or session export**: use dynamic mode with backend logic\\n- **For UX-first tools**: use clipboard and signature check if possible\\n\\nIf you're building for agents, always test your feeds via `LLMFeedHub`, and consider exposing them under `.well-known/`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🎨 Icons & UI Disclaimer\\n\\nIn our reference implementation (e.g. `ExportToLLMButton` on wellknownmcp.org), we use icons like:\\n\\n- 🧠 `BrainCircuit` for the main export\\n- 📋 `Clipboard` for copy actions\\n- 🔐 `Lock` or 🛡️ `Shield` to show signature or certification\\n\\nThese are **purely illustrative**. The mission of `wellknownmcp.org` is not design — it's interoperability, clarity, and trust.\\n\\n### 💡 Want to improve the UI?\\n\\nIf you have better visual ideas, component patterns, or a more elegant way to expose this feature to humans or agents:\\n- 👉 Contribute on GitHub\\n- 💌 Or share your thoughts on [join/](https://wellknownmcp.org/join)\\n\\nThis feature is a **key bridge between humans and agents**. Let's make it intuitive and beautiful — together.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧽 DOM Cleaning Best Practice\\n\\nIf you're using `context: current` (i.e. exporting the live DOM), it's recommended to **clone the document first** before removing any elements.\\n\\nThis prevents breaking or modifying the visible page for your users.\\n\\n```js\\nconst clone = document.documentElement.cloneNode(true)\\ncleanDOM(clone)\\nconst html = clone.outerHTML\\n```\\n\\nThen use `html` in your feed construction or export logic."

Just a file in `.well-known/`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ 1. Create a `.well-known` folder on your site\\n\\nInside it, add a file named:\\n\\n```\\n/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📄 2. Paste this minimal JSON into it:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"mcp\\\",\\n \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n \\\"origin\\\": \\\"https://your-domain.com\\\",\\n \\\"title\\\": \\\"My LLM-Readable Site\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Exposing trusted, agent-readable content via MCP.\\\",\\n \\\"tags\\\": [\\\"llmfeed\\\", \\\"demo\\\", \\\"quickstart\\\"],\\n \\\"generated_at\\\": \\\"2025-05-21T12:00:00Z\\\"\\n },\\n \\\"trust\\\": {\\n \\\"scope\\\": \\\"partial\\\",\\n \\\"signed_blocks\\\": [\\\"feed_type\\\", \\\"metadata\\\", \\\"trust\\\"],\\n \\\"trust_level\\\": \\\"self-issued\\\"\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> 🧠 This file tells agents:\\n> - What this domain is\\n> - What metadata is declared\\n> - What blocks are trusted\\n> - Who signed it (or didn’t)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔍 3. Test it with an LLM\\n\\nOpen Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT and say:\\n\\n> \\\"Can you explain the content of `https://your-domain.com/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`?\\\"\\n\\nIf your LLM supports `.llmfeed.json`, you’ll get a structured summary.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✍️ 4. (Optional) Add a prompt capsule\\n\\nCreate another file at:\\n\\n```\\n/.well-known/prompts/welcome.llmfeed.json\\n```\\n\\nPaste this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n \\\"feed_type\\\": \\\"prompt\\\",\\n \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n \\\"title\\\": \\\"Greeting prompt\\\",\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"Tells an agent how to greet users\\\",\\n \\\"generated_at\\\": \\\"2025-05-21T12:05:00Z\\\"\\n },\\n \\\"prompt\\\": {\\n \\\"intent\\\": \\\"say_hello\\\",\\n \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello! I'm your assistant. How can I help today?\\\",\\n \\\"llm_simplified\\\": true\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔏 5. (Optional) Add a signature\\n\\nGo to [llmfeedforge.org](https://llmfeedforge.org), upload your feed, and request a signature.\\n\\nYou’ll get a `signature` block like this:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"signature\\\": {\\n \\\"algorithm\\\": \\\"ed25519\\\",\\n \\\"value\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPaste it in your file.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧪 6. Explore further\\n\\n- Use `feed_type = export` to share pages \\n- Add `capabilities.llmfeed.json` for your public APIs \\n- Use `trust.certifier` for certified feeds\\n\\n📘 Full spec: [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org) \\n🛠 Forge tools: [llmfeedforge.org](https://llmfeedforge.org)\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou just made your site readable by the next generation of agents.\\n\\nSimple. Signed. Semantic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧪 Test your feed\\n\\nYou can test your `.llmfeed.json` live at [wellknownmcp.org/llmfeedhub](https://wellknownmcp.org/llmfeedhub) — drag and drop it into the preview interface.\\n\\nNeed a way for users to export feeds from your site? \\nCheck out the [Export Button Module](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec/06_scripts/export-button/README)."
