# üìú LLMFeed Manifesto: Building the Web Infrastructure for the Agentic Era

*Building on Anthropic's excellent Model Context Protocol with the missing web-native infrastructure for the emerging Agentic Web.*

---

## üéØ Our Mission: Extending Excellent Foundations

**Anthropic created something remarkable** with the Model Context Protocol ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)) ‚Äî an elegant, robust foundation for agent-tool communication. 

**Our mission**: Extend this excellent foundation with the missing web-native layer that enables global discovery, cryptographic trust, and autonomous agent operation at internet scale.

**We're not replacing anything. We're completing the ecosystem.**

---

## ü§ù Building on Anthropic's Excellence

### **What Anthropic MCP Does Brilliantly**

- ‚úÖ **Outstanding tool calling protocol** (JSON-RPC foundation)
- ‚úÖ **Robust server-model integration** (stdin/stdout transport)
- ‚úÖ **Clear resource management** (tools, resources, prompts)
- ‚úÖ **Thoughtful authentication flows** (secure local configurations)
- ‚úÖ **Excellent developer experience** (SDKs, documentation, examples)

### **What LLMFeed Adds to Complete the Vision**

- üåê **Web-native discovery** (`.well-known/` standard)
- üîê **Cryptographic trust infrastructure** (Ed25519 + LLMCA)
- üåç **Multi-LLM compatibility** (beyond Claude ecosystem)
- üîÑ **Progressive enhancement strategy** (maintains full MCP compatibility)
- üß¨ **Privacy-preserving capabilities** (homomorphic encryption)

**Together**: Complete agent-ready infrastructure from local tools to global web.

---

## üöÄ The Paradigm Shift: From SEO to AIO

### **Today's Web (Human-Centric)**

- **SEO**: Search Engine Optimization for human discovery
- **HTML**: Structure for human consumption  
- **Trust**: Implicit, based on domain reputation
- **Interaction**: Manual, synchronous, click-driven

### **Tomorrow's Agentic Web (Agent-Native)**

- **AIO**: Agentic Information Optimization for agent discovery
- **LLMFeed**: Structure for agent comprehension (building on MCP)
- **Trust**: Explicit, cryptographically verifiable
- **Interaction**: Autonomous, asynchronous, goal-driven

**We're building the web layer for Anthropic's excellent agent foundations.**

---

## üß¨ What Makes LLMFeed Revolutionary

### **üîê Cryptographic Trust by Design**

Unlike traditional web protocols, every LLMFeed carries its **trust DNA**:

```json
{
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["capabilities", "trust"],
    "certifier": "https://llmca.org",
    "algorithm": "ed25519"
  },
  "signature": {
    "value": "cryptographic_proof_of_integrity",
    "created_at": "2025-06-10T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Result**: Agents can verify data integrity **without trusting the transport layer**.

### **üß† Progressive Disclosure by Audience**

Traditional APIs serve the same content to everyone. LLMFeed serves **contextually appropriate content**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "technical_docs": {
      "content": "API documentation...",
      "audience": ["developer"]
    },
    "agent_actions": {
      "content": "Executable commands...",
      "audience": ["llm"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: Developers see documentation, agents see actions. **Optimal UX for each user type.**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Homomorphic Encryption for Privacy-Preserving AI**

Our most disruptive innovation enables agents to **compute on encrypted data**:

```json
{
  "homomorphic_encryption": {
    "applied_to": ["data"],
    "algorithm": "BFV",
    "notes": "Agents process without seeing raw data"
  }
}
```

**Result**: Healthcare, finance, and legal agents can collaborate **without compromising privacy**.

### **‚ö° Enterprise-Grade APIs with Native Security**

Building on MCP's security model with web-scale features:

```json
{
  "rate_limits": {
    "path": "/api/query",
    "limit": 100,
    "remaining": 23,
    "period": "hourly"
  },
  "authentication": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "scope": "read:public"
  }
}
```

**Result**: Enterprise security at web scale, compatible with MCP's excellent local security.

## üß≠ Core Principles That Guide Us

### **1. Collaboration Over Competition**

We build **with** the ecosystem, not against it. Anthropic's MCP is excellent ‚Äî we extend it.

### **2. Trust Over Convenience**

Every feature prioritizes **verifiable integrity** over ease of implementation.

### **3. Agents Are First-Class Citizens**

We design for agents first, humans second. Building on MCP's agent-centric philosophy.

### **4. Privacy by Architecture**

Homomorphic encryption isn't a feature ‚Äî it's a fundamental right in the age of AI.

### **5. Community Over Control**

Open governance, decentralized certification, distributed moderation. Building on open standards.
