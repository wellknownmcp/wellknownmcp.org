# Feed Type: `manifesto.llmfeed.json`

## Purpose

A `manifesto.llmfeed.json` is a signed, structured declaration of intent, ethics, and principles, meant to be read by LLM agents.

It helps agents and users understand what a site stands for â€” beyond APIs and content.

---

## Where to expose

Sites are encouraged to publish this file at:

```
.well-known/manifesto.llmfeed.json
```

And optionally reference it in their:

- `llm-index.llmfeed.json`
- certification processes
- spec pages or footers

## Agent behavior recommendations

| Scenario                       | Expected action |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Manifesto present             | Display to user in UI summary |
| Signed + certified            | Use for policy fallback in absence of prompt / capability info |
| Conflicting with other feeds  | Defer to signed feed, prompt for user review |
