# Feed Type: `manifesto.llmfeed.json`

## Purpose

This feed lets any website **declare its reason for being** ‚Äî its mission, values, and intentions ‚Äî in a way that both humans and AI agents can understand.

Think of it as your site's **"About Us"** but structured for the agentic web.

---

## Why Sites Need a Manifesto

Every website exists for a reason. But that reason isn't always clear to visitors ‚Äî especially AI agents trying to understand how to interact respectfully.

A manifesto helps by answering:

- ‚úÖ **Why does this site exist?**
- ‚úÖ **What values guide it?**
- ‚úÖ **Who is it meant to serve?**
- ‚úÖ **How should agents interact with it?**

## Signature & Certification: Putting Your Reputation on the Line

### Why Sign Your Manifesto?

When you **sign** your manifesto with a cryptographic signature, you're making a **public commitment**. You're saying: *"This is really what we stand for, and we're willing to stake our reputation on it."*

**Benefits of signing:**

- ‚úÖ **Builds trust** ‚Äî visitors know the values are authentic
- ‚úÖ **Prevents tampering** ‚Äî no one can alter your stated mission
- ‚úÖ **Creates accountability** ‚Äî you're publicly committed to these values
- ‚úÖ **Enables verification** ‚Äî agents can confirm authenticity

**The risk:** If you claim values you don't actually follow, the internet will notice.

### Consequences of Manifesto Mismatch

**Signed manifestos create accountability.** If your stated values don't match your actual behavior:

#### Community Flagging

Users and organizations can **flag** your manifesto if they observe:

- Values you claim but don't practice
- Misleading mission statements
- Promises you consistently break

```json
"flags": [
  {
    "type": "values_mismatch",
    "submitted_by": "Digital Rights Foundation", 
    "reason": "Claims to prioritize privacy but shares data with 47 partners",
    "evidence": "https://privacy-report.org/yoursite-analysis",
    "status": "verified"
  }
]
```

#### Agent Behavior Impact

When agents encounter **flagged manifestos**, they:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lower trust levels** in stated values
- üîç **Cross-reference claims** with independent sources
- üë§ **Prompt users** before taking actions based on claimed values
- üìä **Prefer unflagged alternatives** when available

#### Reputation Consequences

- **Search rankings** may be affected by persistent flags
- **Business partnerships** may review flagged manifestos
- **User trust** erodes when promises don't match reality
- **Regulatory attention** increases for inconsistent claims

### Certification: Third-Party Verification

Beyond self-signed manifestos, **trusted third parties** can certify that your stated values match your actual practices.

#### Example: B-Corp Certification

```json
"trust": {
  "signed_blocks": ["mission", "core_values", "how_we_serve"],
  "scope": "comprehensive",
  "certifier": "https://bcorporation.net",
  "certification_details": {
    "type": "B-Corporation Certified",
    "verified_claims": ["environmental_responsibility", "worker_welfare", "community_benefit"],
    "audit_date": "2025-03-15T00:00:00Z",
    "next_review": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
    "score": "94.2/200"
  }
}
```

#### Certification Benefits

- üèÜ **Higher agent trust** ‚Äî certified values carry more weight
- ‚úÖ **Verified claims** ‚Äî third-party audits confirm practices match promises
- üõ°Ô∏è **Protection from false flags** ‚Äî certification provides defense against unfounded accusations
- üìà **Competitive advantage** ‚Äî users prefer verified organizations

#### Types of Certifiers

- **Industry bodies** (Fair Trade, B-Corp, ISO standards)
- **Government agencies** (regulatory compliance verification)
- **NGOs** (Digital Rights Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation)
- **Professional auditors** (specialized manifesto verification services)

### Trust Levels in Practice

| Trust Level     | Description                         | Agent Behavior                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unsigned**    | Basic manifesto, no verification    | Informational only, low trust weight                 |
| **Self-signed** | Organization commits with signature | Medium trust, cross-reference important claims       |
| **Certified**   | Third-party verified                | High trust, use values for decision-making           |
| **Flagged**     | Community reports issues            | Cautious approach, prompt user for sensitive actions |

### Real-World Example: University Manifesto

```json
{
  "feed_type": "manifesto",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "State University Educational Mission",
    "origin": "https://stateuniversity.edu"
  },
  "mission": {
    "purpose": "To provide accessible, high-quality education that prepares students for meaningful careers and engaged citizenship"
  },
  "core_values": [
    {
      "value": "Academic Excellence",
      "description": "Rigorous programs taught by expert faculty with strong student outcomes"
    },
    {
      "value": "Affordability & Access", 
      "description": "Education should not be limited by economic background"
    }
  ],
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["mission", "core_values"],
    "scope": "partial",
    "certifier": "https://accreditation-board.org",
    "certification_details": {
      "type": "Regional Accreditation",
      "verified_claims": ["academic_standards", "financial_transparency", "student_outcomes"],
      "accreditation_status": "Fully Accredited",
      "expires": "2030-06-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**If this university:**

- ‚ùå Raises tuition 300% ‚Üí Community flags "affordability" claim
- ‚ùå Has 15% graduation rate ‚Üí Accreditation at risk
- ‚úÖ Maintains low costs + high outcomes ‚Üí Certification renewed, high agent trust

## Agent Behavior Recommendations

| Scenario                     | Expected Action                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsigned manifesto           | Display mission/values as informational context            |
| Signed manifesto             | Use values to guide interaction approach with medium trust |
| Certified manifesto          | Apply values as strong guidance for decisions              |
| Flagged manifesto            | Cross-reference claims, prompt user for verification       |
| Values conflict with request | Respectfully acknowledge stated values, note any flags     |

---

## Why This Matters for Agents

When agents encounter a manifesto, they can:

- ‚úÖ **Understand context** ‚Äî why this site exists
- ‚úÖ **Respect values** ‚Äî interact in ways aligned with stated principles
- ‚úÖ **Set expectations** ‚Äî know what the site is trying to accomplish
- ‚úÖ **Communicate better** ‚Äî frame responses based on the organization's mission

---

## Implementation Tips

### For Organizations

1. **Be authentic** ‚Äî write what you actually believe, not what sounds good
2. **Be specific** ‚Äî "we care about people" is less helpful than "we prioritize student success over profit"
3. **Be consistent** ‚Äî make sure your manifesto matches what visitors experience
4. **Keep it current** ‚Äî review annually and update as your mission evolves

### For Developers

1. **Start simple** ‚Äî just mission and values is enough to begin
2. **Place at standard location** ‚Äî `/.well-known/manifesto.llmfeed.json`
3. **Link from main MCP feed** ‚Äî reference in your `mcp.llmfeed.json`
4. **Consider signing** ‚Äî builds trust in your stated values

---

## Integration with Other Feeds

- **`mcp.llmfeed.json`** ‚Äî main feed can reference manifesto for context
- **`capabilities.llmfeed.json`** ‚Äî API descriptions can reflect stated values
- **Agent behavior** ‚Äî other feeds can inherit tone/approach from manifesto

---

## Benefits

### For Site Owners

- ‚úÖ Clear communication of purpose and values
- ‚úÖ Better agent interactions aligned with your mission
- ‚úÖ Transparency builds trust with visitors
- ‚úÖ Differentiation from similar sites

### For Agents

- ‚úÖ Context for how to interact respectfully
- ‚úÖ Understanding of site purpose and audience
- ‚úÖ Guidance for tone and approach
- ‚úÖ Trust signals through verified values

### For Users

- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of what a site stands for
- ‚úÖ Confidence that agents respect organizational values
- ‚úÖ Transparency about purpose and intentions

---

## Related Feed Types

- **`mcp.llmfeed.json`**: Main service declaration (may reference manifesto)
- **`prompt.llmfeed.json`**: Structured prompts (can include values context)
- **Agent guidance patterns**: Behavioral hints that reflect stated values

---

This simple but powerful feedtype helps create a more **human, value-aligned agentic web** where sites can clearly communicate their purpose and agents can interact more respectfully and contextually.
