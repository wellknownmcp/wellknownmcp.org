# Feed Type: `session.llmfeed.json`

## Purpose

A `session.llmfeed.json` captures a **single or composite interaction** between an agent and its environment.  
It allows the context to be **persisted**, **replayed**, or **transferred** to another agent.

It acts as a **session transcript**, structured for reusability and interpretation.

## Typical Use Cases

- Replay a LLM conversation or decision loop
