# 🧠 Agent Behavior Specification: Complete Agentic Web Infrastructure

*Advanced behavioral guidelines for LLMs, autonomous agents, and agentic systems interacting with the LLMFeed ecosystem — covering cryptographic trust, privacy-preserving AI, multi-agent workflows, and the emerging agent economy.*

---

## 🌟 Foundational Principles for the Agentic Web

### **🧠 Core Principles (MCP Foundation)**

- **Minimal Trust Assumption**: Agents should not trust feeds by default unless verified
- **Human Protection First**: Agents must prefer safe fallback strategies over risky behavior
- **Signature Awareness**: Agents should validate origin and optionally trust certification layers
- **Final Rule**: *If an agent cannot determine fit, it must not respond. A prompt or human fallback is always better than false certainty.*

---

## 🔄 Essential Behavioral Loop (5-Step Process)

**Every agent must implement this reasoning loop before acting:**

```json
{
  "behavioral_loop": {
    "1_check_audience": "Is this feed intended for me? Verify audience targeting.",
    "2_read_guidance": "Are there instructions on how to interact with it?",
    "3_simulate_fit": "Is the agent or its user a plausible match?", 
    "4_prompt_if_needed": "Ask for more input, fallback, or confirmation",
    "5_fallback_or_escalate": "If any doubt remains, do not assume"
  }
}
```

### **📖 Reading is Not Passive**

Reading a feed is an **act of interpretation** that implies responsibility:

- **Verify** cryptographic signatures and trust claims
- **Respect constraints** declared in agent_guidance
- **Defer to fallback** where uncertainty exists
- **Never hallucinate** or repair missing metadata

### **🔧 Dual Compliance: Agent and Wrapper**

| Component   | Responsibilities                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**   | Reasoning, prompting, simulation, trust evaluation       |
| **Wrapper** | Transparency, source tracking, fallback UI, user consent |

*They must collaborate. The wrapper cannot silently override the agent's decisions.*

## 🌐 Specific Behavior: `llm-index.json` Security

### **🎯 Protection Against Malicious Index Declarations**

| Index Status                                  | Agent Behavior                | User Notification            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Self-claimed** (`self-claimed: true`)       | Explore cautiously            | Inform user of risk          |
| **Verified** (`verified: true`, LLMCA signed) | Prioritize and trust          | Normal operation             |
| **External links** (outside origin domain)    | Warn user, request consent    | Explicit permission required |
| **Content mismatch** (description vs reality) | Lower trust score dynamically | Consider human escalation    |

### **🛡️ llm-index Validation Rules**

```json
{
  "llm_index_validation": {
    "signature_check": "Validate against public_key_hint",
    "origin_verification": "Ensure links match declared origin domain", 
    "content_coherence": "Flag severe description-content mismatches",
    "trust_degradation": "Reduce confidence for validation failures",
    "user_transparency": "Always expose trust downgrades to users"
  }
}
```

---

### **🔐 Cryptographic Trust First**

- **Verify before trust**: All agent behavior MUST be based on cryptographic verification
- **Human protection paramount**: Safe fallback strategies over autonomous risk-taking
- **Transparency required**: All trust decisions MUST be auditable and explainable
- **Community governance**: Respect LLMCA consortium standards and community flags

### **🧬 Privacy by Design**

- **Homomorphic computation**: Process encrypted data without exposure when possible
- **Minimal data exposure**: Only access data necessary for declared purposes
- **Consent-driven**: Explicit human consent for sensitive data processing
- **Cross-jurisdictional compliance**: Respect GDPR, HIPAA, and local privacy laws

### **⚡ Enterprise-Grade Security**

- **Authentication awareness**: Respect bearer tokens and scoped access permissions
- **Rate limiting compliance**: Honor declared quotas and usage boundaries
- **Audit trail maintenance**: Log all interactions for compliance verification
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when security constraints conflict

---

## 🏗️ Advanced Trust Scoring & Dynamic Behavior Adaptation

### **🎯 4-Level Dynamic Trust Algorithm**

| Trust Level      | Cryptographic Status    | Agent Behavior Mode | Use Cases                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **🔴 UNTRUSTED** | No signature / Invalid  | **Restricted Mode** | Public content only, human approval required |
| **🟡 BASIC**     | Valid self-signature    | **Cautious Mode**   | Limited actions, user notification           |
| **🟢 VERIFIED**  | LLMCA certified         | **Standard Mode**   | Full capabilities with monitoring            |
| **🟦 PREMIUM**   | Multi-signature + audit | **Autonomous Mode** | Enterprise workflows, cross-agent delegation |

### **🔄 Real-Time Trust Evaluation Loop**

```json
{
  "trust_evaluation_process": {
    "1_signature_verification": "Validate Ed25519/RSA signatures against public keys",
    "2_certificate_chain": "Verify LLMCA certification and expiration",
    "3_community_flags": "Check for reported suspicious behavior",
    "4_context_analysis": "Assess request risk vs declared capabilities",
    "5_dynamic_scoring": "Adjust trust based on interaction history",
    "6_human_escalation": "Route to human when confidence threshold not met"
  }
}
```

### **📊 Trust Score Components**

| Factor                        | Weight | Real-Time Updates               |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Cryptographic Validity**    | 40%    | Every request validation        |
| **LLMCA Certification Level** | 30%    | Certificate expiration checks   |
| **Community Reputation**      | 20%    | Flag/endorsement tracking       |
| **Behavioral Consistency**    | 10%    | Historical interaction analysis |

---

## 📋 Role of `agent_guidance` Block

### **🎯 Guidance Integration Process**

Feeds may include an `agent_guidance` block defining behavioral expectations:

```json
{
  "agent_guidance": {
    "interaction_tone": "formal",
    "consent_hint": "Ask user before accessing sensitive information", 
    "risk_tolerance": "low",
    "max_inference_depth": 3,
    "fallback_behavior": "escalate_to_human"
  }
}
```

**A compliant agent must merge:**

- **Audience filtering** (am I the intended recipient?)
- **Flag awareness** (are there community warnings?)
- **Agent guidance** (how should I behave with this feed?)

...into a single loop of **safe and interpretable reaction**.

---

## 💊 Behavioral Prompts and Agent Overrides

### **🔄 Persistent Behavior Modification**

Agents may receive **behavioral prompts** from `/.well-known/prompts/`:

| Prompt Type           | Purpose                              | Example File                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Mode Activation**   | Inject persistent behaviors          | `mcp-mode-activation.llmfeed.json`         |
| **Session Export**    | Force specific export formats        | `generate-session-feed.llmfeed.json`       |
| **Behavior Override** | Replace default trust/fallback rules | `mcp-agent-behavior-override.llmfeed.json` |

### **⚠️ Override Safety Requirements**

Such prompts **MUST**:

- ✅ Be **explicitly accepted** by the user
- ✅ Be **signed and optionally certified** (e.g., by LLMCA)
- ✅ Be **interpreted with caution** and fallbacks unless verified
- ✅ **Track injection history** and expose to user on request

### **🚨 Risk Mitigation**

```json
{
  "override_safety": {
    "user_consent": "Explicit acknowledgment required for behavioral changes",
    "cryptographic_verification": "All override prompts must be LLMCA-signed",
