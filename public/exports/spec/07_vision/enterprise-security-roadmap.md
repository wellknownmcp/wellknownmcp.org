## 🚨 The Enterprise AI Security Gap

### **Current State: Chaos and Risk**

```
❌ Employees copy-paste sensitive data to ChatGPT
❌ No visibility into what data leaves the organization  
❌ Compliance violations through uncontrolled AI usage
❌ API keys and credentials accidentally shared
❌ No audit trail for AI-assisted decisions
❌ Shadow AI usage bypassing security policies
```

**The Result**: 89% of enterprises report AI-related data incidents in 2024*

### **LLMFeed Solution: Controlled AI Integration**

```
✅ Automatic PII/credential detection and redaction
✅ Granular consent management for data sharing
✅ Complete audit trail of all AI interactions
✅ Policy enforcement at the OS/browser level
✅ Cryptographic verification of data integrity

```
