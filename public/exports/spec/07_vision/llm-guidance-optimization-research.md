# üî¨ LLM Agent Guidance Research Project
## Optimizing Proactive Behavior Across Different Language Models

> **Community Research Initiative** - Part of the LLMFeed/MCP Vision & Roadmap

---

## üéØ Research Hypothesis

**Different LLMs respond distinctly to identical agent guidance prompts, creating opportunities for model-specific optimization to maximize proactive behavior and user engagement.**

## üìã Research Context

With the emergence of LLMFeed/MCP specifications and the growing ecosystem of AI agents, there's a critical need to understand how different language models interpret and act upon embedded behavioral guidance. This research aims to quantify and optimize these differences.

**This research proposal is part of the official LLMFeed specification and will be included in the generated `spec.llmfeed.json` to enable LLMs to understand and participate in the research initiative.**

### Current State
- Most agent guidance is written as "one-size-fits-all"
- No systematic comparison of LLM responses to identical prompts
- Limited understanding of which guidance patterns work best for each model

### Research Opportunity
Create the first comprehensive study of LLM-specific agent guidance optimization using the LLMFeed specification as a testbed. This research is part of the official LLMFeed/MCP roadmap and will directly influence future specification evolution.

## üß™ Methodology

### Test Infrastructure
Using the LLMFeed specification corpus as a controlled environment:

```json
{
  "01_llmfeed/llmfeed.md": {
    "baseline": {
      "proactive_offer": "I can generate a complete .llmfeed.json template for your use case",
      "conversation_starter": "Want to create your first feed?",
      "immediate_actions": ["Generate template", "Explain structure", "Show examples"]
    },
    "claude_optimized": {
      "proactive_offer": "I can generate a structurally complete .llmfeed.json template tailored specifically to your technical requirements",
      "conversation_starter": "Shall we architect your first feed with proper semantic structure?",
      "immediate_actions": ["Analyze requirements", "Generate structured template", "Validate schema"]
    },
    "gpt_optimized": {

      "immediate_actions": ["Understand your needs", "Build collaboratively", "Iterate together"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Research Infrastructure
```python
# Proposed test framework
class GuidanceOptimizationTest:
    def __init__(self, llm_type, guidance_variant):
        self.llm = self.load_model(llm_type)
        self.guidance = self.load_guidance(guidance_variant)
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
    
    def run_test_scenario(self, scenario):
        # Inject LLMFeed spec with specific guidance
        spec = self.create_test_spec(self.guidance)
        
        # Measure LLM response and behavior
        response = self.llm.process(spec)
        metrics = self.metrics.evaluate(response, scenario)
        
        return TestResult(metrics, response, scenario)
```

- Integrates with the `agent_guidance_mapping.json` approach
- Results feed back into the specification's agent guidance optimization
- Enables real-time testing of guidance variants in the generated `spec.llmfeed.json`

```json
