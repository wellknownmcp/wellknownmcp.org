# Note for GitHub Admins – LLM-Compatible Feed Export

## Purpose

To propose an optional `.llmfeed.json` file at the root of any public GitHub repository, allowing developers to expose a structured, signed, machine-readable representation of their codebase to LLM agents.

## Proposal

- Recognize `.llmfeed.json` as a repository-level metadata export.

- Optionally render a button in the GitHub UI: **“Feed this repo to your LLM”**.

- Support contextual clipboard export (e.g., **“Copy context for LLM”**) to let users generate a dynamic `.llmfeed.json` for selected files or folders.

## Motivation

- Enhances discoverability of trusted, agent-friendly repositories.

- Makes codebases more accessible to LLMs without unstructured scraping.

- Aligns with MCP / LLMFeed open standard ([https://wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org/)).

- Builds on GitHub Copilot Workspaces (Dec 2024), which began structuring context for LLMs natively — `.llmfeed.json` offers an open, signed, interoperable format.

## Developer Benefits

- Exposing a `.llmfeed.json` allows developers to specify exactly what should be read and understood by LLMs: the key files, APIs, usage examples, and trust metadata.

- Enables any LLM (not just GitHub Copilot) to interpret the repository in a certified and structured way.

- Promotes transparent onboarding: users or collaborators can "copy contextual LLM export" from a folder or file and paste it into any LLM interface.

- Facilitates ecosystem reuse: downstream tools and agents can consume `.llmfeed.json` directly, without relying on custom heuristics.

## Alignment with Open Standards

This proposal is aligned with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which encourages:

- Explicit context declaration (vs scraping or guessing).

- Secure trust boundaries via signed blocks.

- Use across platforms, LLMs, and interfaces.

## Virtual `.well-known` per User (optional enhancement)

- GitHub may optionally expose a virtual `.well-known/llmfeed.json` under each user/org namespace (e.g. `/@username/.well-known/llmfeed.json`).

- This allows:
  
  - A unified, signed identity feed for a developer or org.
  
  - LLMs to contextualize users instantly (repos, active projects, preferences, exposed APIs).
  
  - Delegation of trust or feed generation to third-party tools or identity certifiers (e.g. `signed_by: llmca.org`).
  
  - Ecosystem-wide reuse of user context in agents, terminals, IDEs, or documentation tools.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Contributor Onboarding

A `.llmfeed.json` file can allow a new contributor to:

- Understand the project structure instantly.

- Focus on the most relevant parts of the code.

- Ask LLMs targeted questions based on declared context.

### Self-Documenting Projects

Projects can:

- Generate their README, changelogs, and usage guides from structured blocks.

- Offer LLM-friendly onboarding without additional effort.

### Ecosystem Interoperability

Feeds can be:

- Converted into OpenAPI, promptML, or schema.org.

- Injected into CI/CD, security audits, or LLM-enhanced dashboards.

## Security Considerations

- `.llmfeed.json` should avoid exposing secrets or private configuration.

- Use `trust.scope: public | restricted` to explicitly declare visibility.

- GitHub may offer optional scanning for dangerous patterns (e.g., exposed tokens or secrets).

## Identity and Reputation

- Feeds may include `trust.reputation` blocks referencing stars, issues, CI results, and GitHub verification.

- This helps agents rank or prioritize content when multiple `.llmfeed.json` files exist across forks or variants.

## Implementation Suggestions

- Recognize `.llmfeed.json` at repo root and show a badge or contextual dropdown if detected.

- Enable "Copy as LLMFeed" in the file explorer or on any directory.

- Optionally validate the feed via MCP-compatible verification services.

## Community Adoption

We invite the GitHub community to test `.llmfeed.json` today using the LLMFeedForge playground, and to propose evolutions to the MCP-compatible schema via open pull requests at https://github.com/wellknownmcp/llmfeed-spec.

This proposal supports the future of intelligent, contextual, and agent-compatible software development.  
GitHub can lead the standardization of machine-readable context as it once did for README, LICENSE, and `package.json`.
