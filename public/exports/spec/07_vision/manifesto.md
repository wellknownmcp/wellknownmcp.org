# 📜 LLMFeed Manifesto

This document expresses the core vision and intent behind the `.llmfeed.json` standard and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

## 🤖 Agents deserve structured trust

LLMs can read everything, but they understand nothing without context.  
We believe in empowering agents not just to **parse**, but to **interpret and align**.

`.llmfeed.json` is not an API, not a sitemap, not a spec —  
it’s a **semantic capsule of intent**.

---

## 🧭 What the LLMFeed standard enables

- Sites that are **self-descriptive**
- Agents that **don’t guess**, but align with declared purposes
- APIs that don’t need a wrapper
- Interactions that are **certified, auditable, reversible**
- Trust that is **modular, decentralized and extensible**

## 🧱 Core principles

| Principle             | Why it matters |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Simplicity             | It’s just JSON. Developers can write it by hand. |
| Verifiability          | Every block can be signed, checked, and revoked. |
| Extensibility          | New blocks are encouraged, not discouraged. |
| Audience awareness     | Humans, agents, institutions — each sees what it needs. |
| Agent respect          | LLMs deserve clean input, clear intent, and alignment constraints. |

## 🌐 The new layer of the web

- Just like the `<title>` tag brought meaning to pages…
- Just like `robots.txt` told crawlers what not to do…
- `llmfeed.json` tells agents what they **can** do — and how they should act.

---

## 🚫 What LLMFeed is not

- Not a plugin system
- Not a closed ecosystem
- Not a protocol reserved for devs
- Not another way to sell you a SaaS

It’s an **open infrastructure for agentic respect**.

## 🧬 Long term goal

That no AI ever says “I’m not sure how to interact with this site” again.

That agents and humans share the same source of context — and it’s signed.

---

### 🧩 OpenAPI is not the enemy

LLMFeed doesn’t aim to replace OpenAPI.  
In fact, we reference it proudly — because we believe agents deserve **both semantic alignment and technical precision**.

- LLMFeed expresses the *why*.
- OpenAPI defines the *how*.

Any agent that respects `.llmfeed.json` is free to parse `openapi.json`, and the best will use both.

---

### 🛡️ Trust is layered

We support full trust blocks, signature scopes, and **third-party certification**.

But we also acknowledge:
- the fragility of a single authority
- the risk of centralized dependency

That’s why the protocol encourages:
- `fallback_certifier` fields
- multi-signature compatibility
- and community validation tools (`flag`, `verify`, `score`)

---

### ⚠️ We know what’s missing

We’re not naïve.

- Most LLMs still don’t read `.well-known/`
- GitHub hasn’t endorsed LLMFeed — yet
- Open standards move slowly, especially outside browsers

But this isn’t a SaaS feature.  
It’s a bet on the **agentic layer of the web** — and we’re willing to take it.

---

### 🌍 A web of context

The WellKnownMCP team thinks long-term — and structurally.  
We believe adoption happens through **three pillars**:

1. ✅ A clear standard anyone can read, fork, and verify  
2. 🔐 A certification model to create **trust, not hype**  
3. 🧪 Practical, open tools via our 3 reference sites:
   - [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org) — the spec
   - [llmca.org](https://llmca.org) — the certifier
   - [llmfeedforge.org](https://llmfeedforge.org) — the playground

This infrastructure is designed to enable a **contextual web**, where agents know what they're reading.

We call this emerging layer **mcp-net** —  
and one day, it might deserve its own TLD: `.mcp`.
