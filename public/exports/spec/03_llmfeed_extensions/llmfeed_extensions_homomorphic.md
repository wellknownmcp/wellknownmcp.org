# 🛡️ LLMFeed Extension — Homomorphic Encryption

This is a **hypothetical extension** exploring how homomorphic encryption could enhance `.llmfeed.json` feeds as **secure capsules** for multi-agent processing.

A signed `.llmfeed.json` is already a **verifiable capsule** — ensuring the integrity of both payload and context.

Homomorphic encryption would allow agents to **manipulate certain encrypted fields** within that capsule:

✅ without breaking signature integrity  
✅ without exposing raw data  
✅ while enabling **pipeline processing** across agents (healthcare, finance, legal, administration...).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Treat `.llmfeed.json` feeds as **secure processing capsules**.
- Enable **privacy-preserving pipelines** between agents.
- Allow computation on encrypted data without breaking **trust boundaries**.
- Maintain the **integrity** of signed feeds even as agents process the encrypted parts.

## 🛠️ Example

```json
"homomorphic_encryption": {
  "applied_to": ["data"],
  "algorithm": "BFV",
  "public_parameters": "https://example.com/params.json",
  "notes": "Data is homomorphically encrypted to allow LLM-safe processing without exposing raw data."
}
```

## 📚 Fields

| Field               | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| `applied_to`        | List of blocks the encryption applies to (e.g., `["data"]`) |
| `algorithm`         | Encryption algorithm (e.g., `BFV`, `CKKS`, `Paillier`, etc.) |
| `public_parameters` | URL to fetch encryption parameters needed for processing |
| `notes`             | Optional human-readable notes |

---

## 🚦 Agent Behaviour

Agents MAY:

✅ Recognize the presence of `homomorphic_encryption`.  
✅ Adjust their reasoning capabilities accordingly.  
✅ Skip actions requiring access to raw data unless decryption is possible.  
✅ Indicate in UI that data is **homomorphically protected**.  
✅ Preserve the integrity of signed blocks while processing encrypted fields.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not yet a formal part of the LLMFeed standard.
- Dependent on agent capabilities and cryptographic libraries.
- Intended as a forward-looking, experimental extension.

---

## 📡 Summary

Homomorphic encryption can turn signed `.llmfeed.json` feeds into **trusted capsules** for multi-agent workflows:

✅ **Data remains encrypted** → privacy preserved  
✅ **Signatures remain valid** → trust preserved  
✅ **Processing is enabled** → agents can compute on encrypted fields  

This approach could enable **privacy-preserving agent pipelines** in sensitive domains:

- Healthcare  
- Finance  
- Administration  
- Legal processes
