# 📦 LLMFeed Canonical Block Reference

This document provides a **centralized reference** for the standard blocks used in LLMFeed files — whether MCP, Export, Prompt, Credential, Pricing or others.

## 🔐 `trust` block

The `trust` block governs which parts of the feed are verifiably trusted and optionally provides scope or hints.

Typical fields include:

```json
"trust": {
  "signed_blocks": ["feed_type", "metadata", "trust", "data"],
  "scope": "public",
  "certifier": "https://llmca.org",
  "public_key_hint": "https://llmca.org/.well-known/public.pem",
  "algorithm": "ed25519",
  "hints": "critical context integrity"
}
```

---

## 🔏 `signature` block

Used to cryptographically prove the authenticity of specific `signed_blocks`.

```json
"signature": {
  "value": "abc123...",
  "created_at": "2025-06-01T12:34:56Z"
}
```

---

## 🏛️ `certification` block

Issued by a trusted authority (like LLMCA), it certifies the whole feed or key parts of it.

```json
"certification": {
  "issuer": "https://llmca.org",
  "cert_id": "llmca-2025-001",
  "certified_blocks": ["feed_type", "metadata", "trust"],
  "public_key_hint": "https://llmca.org/.well-known/public.pem"
}
```

## 📌 Notes

- Only `feed_type` and `metadata` are **strictly required**
- `trust.signed_blocks` governs what is verifiably trusted
- `signature` and `certification` can co-exist
- Unrecognized blocks should be namespaced
