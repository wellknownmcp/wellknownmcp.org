# üì¶ What is a `.llmfeed.json`?

A **LLMFeed** is a lightweight, signed and structured JSON file that lets any agent ‚Äî including LLMs, copilots, and bots ‚Äî understand what a website, document, or service is about and how to interact with it.

It is the **core data format of the MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

---

## üß† Why it matters

- Machines need **semantic context** and **trust** ‚Äî not just HTML or APIs
- `.llmfeed.json` enables autonomous agents to:
  - Understand content
  - Detect intent
  - Act through capabilities
  - Evaluate cost or risk
  - Verify authorship and trust

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Minimum Structure

All valid feeds must include these two top-level blocks:

```json
{
  "feed_type": "export",
  "metadata": {
    "origin": "https://example.org",
    "title": "Sample Page",
    "generated_at": "2025-05-20T15:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Additional blocks are context-specific:
- `data`, `intent`, `trust`, `capabilities`, `prompts`, `session_state`, `credential`, etc.

## üß± Standard Block Types

| Block           | Purpose                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `feed_type`       | Defines what kind of feed this is              |
| `metadata`        | Describes title, origin, timestamp, etc.       |
| `trust`           | Indicates signed blocks, trust scope           |
| `signature`       | Optional hash and issuer info                  |
| `certification`   | Issued by trusted authority like LLMCA         |
| `data`            | Carries exportable content (HTML, bundle, etc.)|
| `intent`          | Used in prompts, capabilities, or MCP          |
| `audience`        | Optional target (e.g., `llm`, `developer`)     |

## üß© Common Feed Types

| Feed Type     | Use Case                                | Typical Blocks                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `mcp`         | Describe your service/site               | `metadata`, `intent`, `prompts`, `trust` |
| `export`      | Share a page‚Äôs content with agents       | `metadata`, `data`, `trust`              |
| `prompt`      | Structure prompts for reuse              | `intent`, `audience`, `trust`            |
| `session`     | Reconstruct LLM session context          | `metadata`, `session_state`             |
| `credential`  | Share API credentials or access claims   | `metadata`, `scopes`, `rate_limits`     |
| `pricing`     | Describe monetization model              | `pricing_models`, `payment_methods`     |

## üîê Trust and Signature

Feeds can be signed and/or certified using:

```json
"trust": {
  "signed_blocks": ["feed_type", "metadata", "data"],
  "scope": "partial",
  "certifier": "https://llmca.org"
}
```

See [`llmfeed-extensions_signatures.md`](../03_extensions/llmfeed-extensions_signatures.md)

---

## üîÅ Lifecycle

1. Generated by user, script, platform or agent
2. Optionally signed or certified
3. Published (public URL or `.well-known/`)
4. Parsed by agents for interaction
5. May trigger actions, fallback, or ranking

## ü§ù MCP and OpenAPI

While `capabilities[]` provides a simplified way to describe callable functions and services, some developers may wish to include a link to a full OpenAPI specification.

This hybrid model allows agents to:
- Understand the **intent** and **trust level** via MCP
- Use **OpenAPI** for complete parameter definitions, schemas, and responses

### Example:

```json
"capabilities": [
  {
    "type": "endpoint",
    "intent": "get status",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/status"
  },
  {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "https://example.com/.well-known/openapi.json",
    "description": "Full technical spec for backend API"
  }
]
```

**MCP and OpenAPI are complementary**:
- Use MCP for meaning, trust, and discovery.
- Use OpenAPI for detailed technical implementation.
