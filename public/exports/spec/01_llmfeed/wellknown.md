# üåê Exposing Feeds via `.well-known/` - MCP Progressive Enhancement

The `.well-known/` directory is the **anchor of discoverability** in the LLMFeed and MCP ecosystem.

It allows any agent ‚Äî human, LLM or crawler ‚Äî to find structured, signed information about your site's purpose, services, pricing, and trust level. This specification builds upon **Anthropic's excellent Model Context Protocol** ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)) with optional enhancements for enhanced agent trust and behavior.

---

## ü§ù MCP Compatibility & Enhancement

**Anthropic's Model Context Protocol** ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)) provides excellent agent-tool communication. **Standard `.mcp.json` works perfectly** and should remain your primary implementation.

**LLMFeed complements MCP** with optional enhancements: cryptographic trust, agent behavioral guidance, and progressive disclosure - all while maintaining full compatibility.

**Migration philosophy**: Test enhanced features gradually without breaking existing MCP implementations.

---

## ‚úÖ Purpose

Using `.well-known/` lets you:

- Declare machine-readable intent for your website or service
- Publish agent-compatible feeds (static or dynamic)
- Allow verification, reputation tracking, and search
- Enable agents to auto-configure themselves for interaction
- **Enhance standard MCP** with optional trust and behavioral features
- **Bridge to future standards** while maintaining current compatibility

---

## üîó Progressive Enhancement Strategy *(Validated June 2025)*

**For existing MCP implementations**, you can test enhanced features by adding a single discovery link to your standard `.mcp.json`:

### **Step 1: Keep Your Standard MCP** *(Recommended)*
```json
// /.mcp.json - Your standard Anthropic MCP configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/postgres-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--connection-string", "postgresql://..."],
      "env": { "CACHE_DIR": "/tmp" }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Add Optional Discovery Link** *(Test Enhancement)*
```json
// /.mcp.json - Enhanced with discovery link
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/postgres-mcp-server", 
      "args": ["--connection-string", "postgresql://..."],
      "env": { "CACHE_DIR": "/tmp" }
    }
  },
  
  // Optional: Link to enhanced LLMFeed version for testing
  "llmfeed_extension": "/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json"
}
```

### **Step 3: Create Enhanced Version** *(Copy + Extend)*
```json
// /.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json - MCP + LLMFeed enhancements
{
  "feed_type": "mcp",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Enhanced PostgreSQL API",
    "origin": "https://api.example.com",
    "description": "Standard MCP + enhanced trust and agent guidance"
  },
  
  // Copy your MCP configuration exactly
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/postgres-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--connection-string", "postgresql://..."],
      "env": { "CACHE_DIR": "/tmp" }
    }
  },
  
  // Enhanced features
  "agent_guidance": {
    "interaction_tone": "professional",
    "fallback_behavior": "ask_user_for_clarification"
  },
  
  // Optional trust for future autonomy
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["mcpServers", "agent_guidance"],
    "scope": "public"
  }
}
```

**Test results**: Claude na√Øf successfully detected discovery links and requested user permission before accessing enhanced features - proving safe coexistence and progressive enhancement potential.

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Zero risk**: Standard MCP clients continue working unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Progressive testing**: Enhanced agents get additional features  
- ‚úÖ **Future readiness**: Infrastructure prepared for industry evolution
- ‚úÖ **Standards convergence**: Smooth path if/when industry adopts enhanced standards

## üìÅ Expected Files and Structure

At minimum, the following files can be served from your domain:

| File | Purpose |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.mcp.json` | **Standard Anthropic MCP** (recommended baseline) |
| `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` | Enhanced MCP + LLMFeed features (optional) |
| `/.well-known/capabilities.llmfeed.json` | Actionable API functions or declared services |
| `/.well-known/llm-index.llmfeed.json` | Directory of all feeds exposed on this site |
| `/.well-known/pricing.llmfeed.json` | (Optional) Declares pricing and billing logic |
| `/.well-known/prompts/prompt-index.llmfeed.json` | (Optional) Index of agent-intent trigger phrases |

You may also expose:

- `/.well-known/public.pem` or `/.well-known/trust/llmca-certificate.json` ‚Üí for verification
- `/.well-known/prompts/*.llmfeed.json` ‚Üí reusable structured prompts
- `/.well-known/export/*.llmfeed.json` ‚Üí static content packs or data bundles

**Migration approach**: Start with standard MCP, add discovery link for testing, gradually enhance based on results.

---

## üß± Static vs Dynamic

Feeds can be:

- **Static**: stored in `/public/.well-known/`
- **Dynamic**: served from a route (e.g. `/api/llmfeed/static/mcp`)

Agents treat both equally ‚Äî as long as the URL and format are consistent.

**For MCP compatibility**: Ensure your standard `.mcp.json` remains static and predictable while enhanced features can be dynamic.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Trust and Signature Expectations

Your `.well-known/` should allow validation of feeds:

- Signed blocks declared via `trust.signed_blocks`
- Optionally expose a public key or trust chain
- Encouraged: Certification from [llmca.org](https://llmca.org)

**Evolution timeline** *(based on validation tests)*:
- **Current (June 2025)**: User consent required for discovery links  
- **Future evolution**: Trust-based progressive autonomy as industry adopts enhanced standards
- **Standard MCP**: Always continues working with human oversight model

**Philosophy**: Enhanced trust features complement MCP's excellent tool calling with autonomous behavior capabilities.

---

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë User Spaces (Multi-User Platforms)

On platforms like `github.com/username`, `medium.com/@handle`, or `france-care.fr/john`, feeds may be **user-scoped**.

If `.well-known/` cannot be served per-user:

- Declare `userspaces: true` in `llm-index`

- Use URLs like:
  
  ```
  /.well-known/users/github.com/username/mcp.llmfeed.json
  ```

Agents that support `userspaces` will automatically check subfeeds.

**MCP compatibility**: This extends standard MCP user support with enhanced user-scoped features.

---

## üß™ Real-World Examples

| Site | Standard MCP | Enhanced LLMFeed | Status |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| `https://wellknownmcp.org` | `/.mcp.json` | `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` | Testing coexistence |
| `https://demo.llmfeedforge.org` | Standard tools | `export`, `session`, `prompt-index` | Enhanced features |

**Recommended approach**: Implement standard MCP first, then test enhanced features with discovery links.

- [`trust & signature`](../03_llmfeed_extensions/llmfeed_extensions_signatures.md)

---

## üìò OpenAPI and `.well-known/`

Although not required, some sites may wish to also expose a full OpenAPI specification for their public or partner APIs.

To do so, you may serve:

```
/.well-known/openapi.json
```

You can link this file from your `capabilities.llmfeed.json` using a capability block with `"type": "openapi"`.

This helps agents ‚Äî both human and LLM ‚Äî understand the precise inputs, outputs, and schema details of your API services.

**Hybrid approach**: Standard MCP for tool calling + OpenAPI for schemas + LLMFeed for trust and behavioral guidance.

---

## üß† Agent Prompts and Behavior Capsules

The `.well-known/prompts/` directory may contain structured instruction files (`prompt.llmfeed.json`) that are designed to be interpreted by agents, not end users.

These prompts can:

- Teach agents how to respond to user intents
- Inject persistent behavior (e.g. always export sessions as `.llmfeed.json`)
- Trigger agent override modes when consented and signed

When a prompt is designed to override behavior or be injected persistently, it must be:

- Signed (`trust.signed_by`)
- Marked as requiring consent (`trust.consent_required`)
- Optionally certified by [llmca.org](https://llmca.org)

Example prompts:

- `mcp-mode-activation.llmfeed.json`
- `generate-session-feed.llmfeed.json`
- `mcp-agent-behavior-override.llmfeed.json`

**Compatibility note**: These behavioral prompts complement standard MCP tool definitions with agent guidance for appropriate usage.

---

## üöÄ Strategic Vision

**Current reality**: Anthropic's MCP provides excellent tool calling foundation  
**Enhanced possibility**: LLMFeed adds trust, behavioral guidance, and autonomous capabilities  
**Future convergence**: Industry evolution toward enhanced standards with backward compatibility

**This specification positions you for both current MCP compatibility and future enhanced agent capabilities** - test safely, enhance gradually, maintain compatibility always.

The goal is **seamless evolution**, not disruptive replacement.
