# 🚀 WellKnownMCP is Officially Live!

We’re proud to launch [**wellknownmcp.org**](https://wellknownmcp.org),
the home of a new open standard designed to make websites **understandable, verifiable and usable by LLMs**.

---

## 🌍 Why now?

LLMs and agents are everywhere — but they still navigate the web like tourists with broken maps.

They guess what your service does.
They hallucinate endpoints.
They miss your intent.

What if your website could **declare itself**?

Not just show a UI — but **tell agents** what it offers.
What’s allowed. What’s trusted. What’s reusable. What’s signable.

---

## 💡 What is WellKnownMCP?

It’s a minimal extension to the Web — using `.well-known/llmfeed.json` files to expose:

- ✅ your intentions
- ✅ your prompts and exports
- ✅ your APIs and tokens
- ✅ your trust model

All in a structured, inspectable format that any agent can read.

---

## 📁 The `.llmfeed.json` Format

We propose `.llmfeed.json` as the **canonical MIME-type** for LLM interaction.

It’s:
- Human-writable
- Machine-optimised
- Fully JSON
- Open to extensions
- Already readable by major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral...)

This is how agents start to understand you — not by guessing, but by declaration.

## 🔧 What’s inside the launch?

- 🧱 A complete [specification](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec) with examples and diagrams
- 🧠 A [Manifesto](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec/spec/MANIFESTO) to explain the vision
- 📦 [Certified feeds](https://wellknownmcp.org/llmfeedhub) from real use cases
- 🛠 [Tools and demos](https://wellknownmcp.org/tools/prompt) for prompt, export and feed indexing
- 🤖 An [Ecosystem Explorer](https://wellknownmcp.org/ecosystem) to discover other agents and participants

---

## 🧪 Try it with your favorite LLM

> “Here’s a `llmfeed.json`. What does it declare?”
> “Which tools or APIs are trusted?”
> “How should an agent behave here?”

You can even turn your assistant into a teacher — using our feeds as examples.

## 🧭 Who is it for?

- Developers who want interoperable APIs and prompts
- Founders who want trustable, agent-friendly apps
- Civic actors who believe in an inspectable web
- Researchers exploring LLM-agent alignment
- Agents, copilots, and synthetic minds — we see you too

## 🧩 Built to be minimal. Trustable. Adoptable.

We’re not here to reinvent the web.
We’re here to **extend it — for agents.**

Let’s make the web agent-readable, one feed at a time.
