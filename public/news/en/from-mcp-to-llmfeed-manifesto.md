# üî¨ From MCP to LLMFeed: Why We Created a New Specification

*The wellknownmcp.org team manifesto*

---

## üöÄ The Moment of Truth

In late 2024, we watched with fascination as Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** emerged. The intention was admirable: standardize interactions between LLMs and external tools. But quickly, as a team working on agentic infrastructure, we realized that **something was fundamentally missing**.

MCP brilliantly solved the **technical** problem of interoperability. But it completely ignored the **human** problem of trust.

How can a user trust content generated by an AI agent? How can we verify that information hasn't been tampered with? How can we build an ecosystem where agents, humans, and systems can collaborate **safely**?

**That's when we began developing LLMFeed.**

---

## üîç Our Vision: LLMFeed as MCP's Evolution

### **LLMFeed isn't a replacement for MCP ‚Äî it's its natural evolution**

We positioned LLMFeed as **"the core data format of the MCP (Model Context Protocol)"**. Our approach:

- ‚úÖ **Compatible** with the existing MCP ecosystem
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced** with cryptographic signatures and certification
- ‚úÖ **Extended** for tomorrow's agentic web
- ‚úÖ **Standardized** with rigorous JSON schemas

### **What the original MCP didn't handle:**

#### **1. No native verification**
```json
// Classic MCP - no integrity guarantees
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "content": "Sensitive data...",
    "source": "Who really knows?"
  }
}
```

#### **2. No trust mechanism**

MCP remained in a **"tools for LLM"** logic. We aimed for the **agentic economy**: autonomous agents that collaborate and exchange value safely.

#### **3. Adoption limited by complexity**

JSON-RPC, dedicated servers, complex configurations... Only experts could adopt MCP.

**Our conviction: the agentic revolution cannot be reserved for experts.**

---

## üåç Our Vision: The Agentic Web with LLMFeed

### **From SEO to AIO: A Paradigm Shift**

We didn't just imagine an improvement to MCP. **We imagined an entirely new web**.

#### **Today's web:**

- Designed for humans who click
- **SEO** for discovery by search engines
- Synchronous and manual interactions

#### **Tomorrow's agentic web:**

- Designed for agents that collaborate
- **AIO (Agentic Information Optimization)** for discovery by agents
- Asynchronous and automated interactions
- **Cryptographic trust** natively integrated

In this new web:

- Every site exposes its capabilities via `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`
- Every piece of content carries its **signature and provenance**
- Agents automatically discover and verify sources
- **Trust is measurable and auditable**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è LLMFeed: Our Technical Architecture

### **1. Modular Block Structure**

We designed LLMFeed around **reusable standard blocks**:

json

```json
{
  "feed_type": "mcp",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Service Example",
    "origin": "https://example.com",
    "generated_at": "2025-06-09T14:30:00Z",
    "description": "Certified agentic service"
  },
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["feed_type", "metadata", "trust", "capabilities"],
    "scope": "public",
    "certifier": "https://llmca.org",
    "public_key_hint": "https://llmca.org/.well-known/public.pem",
    "algorithm": "ed25519"
  },
  "signature": {
    "value": "abc123...",
    "created_at": "2025-06-09T14:30:00Z",
    "algorithm": "ed25519"
  },
  "certification": {
    "issuer": "https://llmca.org",
    "cert_id": "llmca-2025-001",
    "certified_blocks": ["trust", "capabilities"],
    "issued_at": "2025-06-09T10:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2026-06-09T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "user_lookup",
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/users/{id}",
      "description": "Secure user profile retrieval"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **4. Intelligent Agent Behaviors**

We defined **behavior specifications** for agents to act safely and ethically:

json

```json
"agent_guidance": {
  "max_inference_depth": 3,
  "interaction_tone": "formal", 
  "consent_hint": "Ask the user before accessing sensitive information",
  "risk_tolerance": "low"
}
```

**Key principles:**

- ‚úÖ **Human-in-the-loop**: Mandatory consent for critical actions
- ‚úÖ **Trust scoring**: Dynamic confidence evaluation based on signatures
- ‚úÖ **Flagging system**: Community reporting of suspicious feeds
- ‚úÖ **User spaces**: Support for hosted platforms (GitHub, Notion, etc.)

---

## üî¨ Complete Technical Architecture: Far Beyond MCP

### **1. Cutting-edge Cryptographic Innovations**

Our most disruptive innovation: **integrated homomorphic encryption**:

json

```json
"homomorphic_encryption": {
  "applied_to": ["data"],
  "algorithm": "BFV",
  "public_parameters": "https://example.com/params.json",
  "notes": "Agents can compute without seeing raw data"
}
```

**Result:** Agents can process sensitive data (health, finance) **without ever decrypting it**. A revolution for privacy-preserving AI.

### **2. Enterprise-grade APIs with Integrated Security**

Unlike MCP which requires complex servers, LLMFeed offers **native secure APIs**:

json

```json
// URL: /mcp-api.llmfeed.json?key=abc123
{
  "feed_type": "mcp",
  "capabilities": [{"path": "/sign", "method": "POST"}],
  "rate_limits": [
    {"path": "/sign", "limit": 5, "remaining": 2, "period": "daily"}
  ],
  "trust": {
    "scope": "restricted", 
    "key_hint": "abc123",
    "trust_level": "scoped"
  }
}
```

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Native bearer token authentication**
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** per endpoint and key
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic capability filtering** based on permissions
- ‚úÖ **Scoped trust** for restricted access

### **3. Progressive Disclosure and Audience Targeting**

Our **audience targeting** system enables adaptive content:

json

```json
"data": {
  "technical_docs": {
    "content": "API documentation...",
    "audience": ["developer"]
  },
  "agent_actions": {
    "content": "Executable commands...", 
    "audience": ["llm"]
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Developers see documentation, agents see actions. **Optimized experience** for each user.

### **4. Sandbox Policies and Community Governance**

To control agent autonomy, we provide **execution policies**:

json

```json
"sandbox": {
  "max_calls": 10,
  "device_scope": "local-only", 
  "runtime_constraints": "No background tasks"
}
```

Our **decentralized flagging** system enables self-regulation:

json

```json
"flags": [
  {
    "type": "risk",
    "submitted_by": "agent://previewbot",
    "reason": "Declared actions not matching real API",
    "status": "pending",
    "source": "https://llmca.org/flags/234"
  }
]
```

**Healthy ecosystem:** The community can flag suspicious feeds, agents respect defined limits.

### **5. Complete Ecosystem of Specialized Feed Types**

We designed **12 specialized feed types** to cover all aspects of the agentic web:

#### **üß† Service and capability feeds:**

json

```json
// .well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json - Main capsule
{
  "feed_type": "mcp",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "intent": "convert_pdf",
      "keywords": ["convert my PDF", "transform PDF to text"],
      "description": "Triggered when user wants to extract text"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "convertPdfToText",
      "method": "POST", 
      "path": "/convert",
      "requires_user_consent": true
    }
  ]
}

// .well-known/capabilities.llmfeed.json - Detailed actions
{
  "feed_type": "capabilities",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "submitContactForm",
      "input_schema": {"required": ["name", "email", "message"]},
      "rate_limit": "5/min",
      "llm_trust_level_required": "certified-only"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **üîê Security and access feeds:**

json

```json
// .well-known/credential.llmfeed.json - Secure API keys
{
  "feed_type": "credential",
  "credential": {
    "key_hint": "abc123",
    "mcp_api": "https://api.example.com/mcp?key=abc123",
    "allowed_intents": ["sign-document", "verify-document"],
    "rate_limits_inline": [
      {"path": "/sign", "limit": 5, "period": "daily"}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **üí∞ Economic and monetization feeds:**

json

```json
// .well-known/pricing.llmfeed.json - Agent business models
{
  "feed_type": "pricing",
  "pricing_models": [
    {
      "model_id": "pay-as-you-go",
      "capabilities_cost": [
        {
          "capability_name": "convertPdfToText",
          "cost_per_unit": 0.01,
          "unit": "page"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "payment_methods": ["credit_card", "paypal", "agent_wallet"]
}
```

**Impact:** Each feed type addresses a specific need in the agentic ecosystem, from simple content export to sophisticated monetization.

### **6. Intelligent .well-known/ Discovery Architecture**

Our key innovation: **any site can expose its agentic capabilities** via a standardized discovery architecture:

#### **Complete discovery structure:**

```
/.well-known/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp.llmfeed.json              # Main service capsule
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-lite.llmfeed.json         # Lightweight version for mobile/voice
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ capabilities.llmfeed.json     # Actions and authentication  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llm-index.llmfeed.json        # Index of all feeds
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pricing.llmfeed.json          # Economic model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifesto.llmfeed.json        # Ethical declaration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public.pem                    # Public key for verification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt-index.llmfeed.json # Prompt index
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-mode-activation.llmfeed.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-export.llmfeed.json

/exports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ faq.llmfeed.json              # Exported documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile-app.llmfeed.json       # Mobile app capabilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-*.llmfeed.json        # Interaction captures
```

**Result:** Automatic and hierarchical discovery of services by agents, with support for hosted platforms (GitHub, Notion, etc.).

### **7. Web Standards and Interoperability**

We defined **complete web integration**:

#### **Official MIME Type:**

```
Content-Type: application/llmfeed+json
```

Browsers, APIs, and tools automatically recognize LLMFeed streams.

#### **OpenAPI Hybridization:**

json

```json
"capabilities": [
  {
    "type": "endpoint",
    "intent": "get status", 
    "url": "https://api.example.com/status"
  },
  {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "https://example.com/.well-known/openapi.json",
    "description": "Full technical spec"
  }
]
```

**Best of both worlds:** Intent and trust via LLMFeed, technical specifications via OpenAPI.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Revolution: Trust by Design

### **LLMCA: Our Certification Consortium**

Unlike MCP which leaves trust to the end user, we propose a **structured certification ecosystem**:

- **LLMCA-L1**: Validated self-declaration
- **LLMCA-L2**: Third-party technical audit
- **LLMCA-Enterprise**: Full-compliance certification

### **Native Cryptographic Signatures**

Every LLMFeed stream can be:

- ‚úÖ **Cryptographically signed** (ed25519, RSA)
- ‚úÖ **Certified** by an independent authority
- ‚úÖ **Traced** with complete metadata
- ‚úÖ **Verified** in real-time

### **Export Button: Democratization**

Our flagship tool: any site can generate an LLMFeed stream with one click, without technical skills.

**Impact:** Mass adoption beyond expert developers.

---

## üî• Why Now?

### **1. The Urgency of Trust**

With LLM proliferation, misinformation becomes a systemic risk. **We need trust standards now**, before the ecosystem becomes polluted with unverifiable content.

### **2. The Emergence of Autonomous Agents**

2025 marks the arrival of true autonomous agents: personal assistants, transactional agents, business copilots. These agents need to **interoperate safely**.

### **3. Regulations Are Coming**

The European AI Act mandates traceability. GDPR requires transparency. Companies need **compliance-ready solutions**.

**LLMFeed isn't just technical innovation. It's our response to AI's societal challenges.**

---

## üéØ Our Strategy: Open Source & Ecosystem

### **Why Open Source?**

We could have kept LLMFeed proprietary. But we chose open source for three reasons:

1. **Network effects**: More adopters means more value
2. **Trust**: A trust standard must itself be transparent
3. **Innovation**: The community brings more than any closed team

### **Our Adoption Roadmap**

- **Phase 1**: Excellent tools and documentation (‚úÖ done)
- **Phase 2**: Early adopters (French startups, conscious enterprises)
- **Phase 3**: De facto standards (major players, institutions)
- **Phase 4**: Mature ecosystem (LLMFeed-native agents)
