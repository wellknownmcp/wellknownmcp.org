# ‚ùì Comprehensive FAQ ‚Äî MCP & LLMFeed

*Updated June 19, 2025 ‚Äî Includes latest validation tools, credential management, and GitHub community insights*

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is MCP in one sentence?
It's an open protocol that lets **LLM-based agents** understand **what a site offers**, **how to interact**, and **what trust level to assign** ‚Äî through structured, signed, declarative feeds.

**Think of it as**: *"robots.txt for intent, HTTPS for trust, but designed for AI."*

**Note**: This builds on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) by adding web-scale discovery and trust verification.

üëâ **Deep dive**: [MCP Explained](https://wellknownmcp.org/tools/mcp-explained) ‚Äî Understanding both Anthropic's MCP and web enhancements

### What is LLMFeed?
It's the **canonical JSON format** used by MCP. The `.llmfeed.json` structure is:

‚úÖ Simple and human-readable  
‚úÖ Designed to be **LLM-friendly**  
‚úÖ Composable and extensible  
‚úÖ Trust-aware (signed, certifiable)  
‚úÖ Declarative, not imperative  

**In other words**: *"JSON that speaks fluent AI."*  

### How does this relate to Anthropic's MCP?
**They're complementary layers of the same vision:**

| Anthropic MCP | WellKnownMCP/LLMFeed |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Client-Server Integration** | **Web-Scale Discovery** |
| JSON-RPC protocol | `.well-known/` standards |
| Deep tool integration | Universal feed discovery |
| Claude-optimized | Multi-LLM compatible |
| Server connections | Trust & verification |

**The relationship**: Anthropic built the **connection protocol**, we built the **discovery layer**.

**Real-world analogy**: *"Anthropic's MCP is like USB-C (the connection). LLMFeed is like DNS (the discovery)."*

**Use both**: Anthropic MCP for deep integrations, LLMFeed for web-scale discovery and trust.

üëâ **Complete explanation**: [MCP Explained](https://wellknownmcp.org/tools/mcp-explained) ‚Äî How Anthropic's MCP works + web discovery enhancements

### What is the "Agentic Web"?
An emerging vision where **LLM-based agents** are first-class citizens of the Web ‚Äî not just consumers of HTML, but actors with **intent**, **trust boundaries**, and **interaction models**.

MCP provides the **contextual layer** these agents need to operate safely and transparently.

**Think**: *"The web, but agents don't have to guess what you mean."*

### Why `.well-known` and not a plugin/SDK?
Because `.well-known` makes MCP:

‚úÖ **Discoverable** (standard location per RFC 8615)  
‚úÖ **Decentralized** (no central registry bottlenecks)  
‚úÖ **Composable** (works with existing web architecture)  
‚úÖ **Independently auditable** (anyone can verify)  
‚úÖ **Progressive enhancement** (works without, better with)

**Context**: This aligns with active GitHub discussions about **centralized registry vs decentralized discovery** in the MCP community.

**Bottom line**: *"We chose web standards over vendor lock-in."*

### Wait, what's this "I know kung fu" thing?
**Our favorite easter egg!** ü•ã

It's a **compatibility test** hidden in our feeds. When you say *"I know kung fu"* to an LLM that has read our `.llmfeed.json` files, it should respond with something that proves it understood the MCP structure.

**Why Matrix?** Because like Neo downloading kung fu, LLMs can "download" structured knowledge from our feeds instead of guessing from HTML.

**Try it yourself**:
1. Feed any of our `.llmfeed.json` files to Claude/ChatGPT
2. Say "I know kung fu"  
3. See if they respond with MCP-aware content

**It's our way of testing**: *"Does this LLM really understand structured feeds, or is it just pretending?"*

**Fun fact**: GPT-4o passed this test immediately. Claude took a few tries. Gemini... still working on it. üòÑ

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Which feed type should I use when?

| Feed Type | Use Case | Example | New in 2025 |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `mcp` | Main site declaration | Service capabilities, trust level | Enhanced discovery |
| `credential` | **API access & permissions** | **Scoped tokens, agent authorization** | **‚ú® NEW** |
| `capabilities` | **Detailed API definitions** | **Tool specs, OpenAPI integration** | **‚ú® Enhanced** |
| `export` | Shareable content | Documentation, articles, FAQs | Signature validation |
| `prompt` | Reusable instructions | Agent behavior guidelines | Trust verification |
| `session` | Context replay | Conversation history, decision trails | Audit support |
| `pricing` | Economic models | Costs, billing, payment methods | Agent billing |

### How do I validate feeds now?
**Honest answer: It's ridiculously simple.**

**The most effective validation method:**

1. **Feed the spec to your LLM**:
   - Add `spec.llmfeed.json` and `schema.llmfeed.json` to your LLM's project knowledge
   - Or just paste them into a chat with Claude/GPT-4

2. **Ask your LLM to validate**:
   ```
   "Here's my MCP feed, validate it and fix any issues"
   ```

3. **That's it.** Your LLM becomes an expert validator instantly.

**Why this works**:
- üìÑ **It's just structured JSON** ‚Äî LLMs understand JSON natively
- üß† **Spec contains all validation rules** ‚Äî complete implementation knowledge
- ‚ö° **Instant feedback** ‚Äî no tools to install, no APIs to call
- üîß **Auto-generation** ‚Äî LLMs can create any feed type from scratch

**Current "official" tools**:
- ‚úÖ **LLMFeedHub** (visual upload testing)
- ‚úÖ **Verification API** (if you want to be formal about it)
- ‚úÖ **Schema files** (for traditional JSON validation)

**Coming soon** (because developers love tools):
- üîú **VSCode extensions** ‚Äî community will build them
- üîú **Cursor/Windsurf integrations** ‚Äî popular demand drives development  
- üîú **CLI tools** ‚Äî because some people prefer terminals

**Reality check**: The LLM approach is faster and more accurate than any tool we could build. The AI understands the intent, not just the syntax.

### How do I handle API credentials securely?
**Use the new `credential` feed type**:

```json
{
  "feed_type": "credential",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Analytics API Access",
    "origin": "https://analytics.example.com"
  },
  "credential": {
    "key_hint": "anl_pro_...9k4m",
    "mcp_api": "https://analytics.example.com/.well-known/mcp-api.llmfeed.json",
    "allowed_intents": ["read_reports", "create_dashboards"],
    "rate_limits": {"requests_per_minute": 500},
    "delegation_enabled": true
  },
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["metadata", "credential"],
    "trust_level": "certified"
  }
}
```

**Why credential feeds?**:
- üîê **Cryptographic integrity** vs plain API keys
- üéØ **Scoped permissions** (not admin access)
- ü§ñ **Agent delegation** (secure multi-agent workflows)
- üìä **Audit trails** (complete provenance tracking)

### Can I use MCP with my existing OpenAPI spec?
**Absolutely!** LLMFeed is designed to complement OpenAPI:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "type": "endpoint",
      "intent": "get user profile",
      "url": "/api/users/{id}",
      "openapi_operation_id": "getUserProfile"
    },
    {
      "type": "openapi",
      "url": "/.well-known/openapi.json",
      "description": "Complete API specification"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best of both worlds**: LLMFeed provides intent and trust, OpenAPI provides technical details.

### What about rate limiting and agent behavior?
**Declare limits explicitly** so agents can respect them:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "search",
      "rate_limit": "10/minute",
      "burst_limit": 3,
      "requires_user_consent": true,
      "risk_level": "low"
    }
  ],
  "agent_behavior": {
    "autonomous_execution": false,
    "human_in_loop": "required",
    "consent_required": ["write_operations", "external_requests"]
  }
}
```

### How do I handle sites behind authentication?
**Use scoped credential feeds**:

```json
{
  "feed_type": "credential",
  "credential": {
    "auth_method": "oauth2",
    "scopes": ["read:profile", "write:settings"],
    "mcp_api": "/api/mcp?key=abc123",
    "session_duration": "1h",
    "refresh_token_available": true
  }
}
```

### How does automatic discovery work with /.well-known?
**RFC 8615 compliant web-scale MCP discovery**:

**The Problem**: Standard Anthropic MCP requires manual configuration on each client. Web agents can't automatically discover your MCP servers.

**The Solution**: Place enhanced MCP configuration at `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` for automatic discovery.

**Migration Path** (3 minutes):
1. **Keep your existing MCP** ‚Üí Zero changes to current setup
2. **Add discovery link** ‚Üí One line: `"llmfeed_extension": "/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json"`
3. **Create enhanced file** ‚Üí Copy MCP config + add metadata and trust features

**What agents get**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic discovery** via RFC 8615 standard
- ‚úÖ **Rich metadata** and behavioral guidance  
- ‚úÖ **Trust verification** through cryptographic signatures
- ‚úÖ **Universal compatibility** across all LLM platforms

## üõ°Ô∏è Trust & Security

### How is trust handled?
**Comprehensive trust infrastructure**:

‚úÖ **Cryptographic signatures** (Ed25519, tamper-proof)  
‚úÖ **Trust hierarchy** (unsigned ‚Üí signed ‚Üí certified ‚Üí enterprise)  
‚úÖ **Third-party certification** (LLMCA authority)  
‚úÖ **Audit trails** (complete provenance tracking)  
‚úÖ **Revocation lists** (instant signature invalidation)

üëâ **Complete guide**: [Why Sign MCP Feeds?](https://wellknownmcp.org/why-sign) ‚Äî Understanding the trust foundation for the agent web

### What's this LLMCA certification process?
**Three-tier certification system**:

| Level | Cost | Requirements | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Individual** | Free | Domain control, basic identity | Personal blogs, open source |
| **Organization** | $100/year | Business registration, security audit | SaaS, startups |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | SOC2/ISO27001, dedicated support | Fortune 500, regulated industries |

**Process**: Identity verification ‚Üí Technical validation ‚Üí Reputation assessment ‚Üí Certification issuance

**Value**: Higher trust scores, premium discovery, enterprise compliance, marketing advantage

### How do I get LLMCA certified?
**Step-by-step process**:

1. **Prepare**: Valid signed feed + domain control + business docs
2. **Apply**: Submit to https://llmca.org/certify
3. **Verify**: Identity, technical, and reputation checks
4. **Receive**: Certification block added to your feed
5. **Maintain**: Continuous monitoring and renewal

**Enterprise benefits**: SOC2 compliance, audit automation, instant verification, dedicated support

### What if someone spoofs my feeds?
**Multiple protection layers**:

- üîê **Signatures prevent spoofing** (only you have your private key)
- ‚úÖ **Agents verify before trusting** (broken signatures = rejected)
- üèõÔ∏è **Certification adds authority** (LLMCA validates identity)
- üìã **Revocation lists** (instant invalidation if compromised)

**Security philosophy**: *"Trust, but verify. Actually, just verify."*

### How do I revoke a compromised signature?
```json
{
  "trust": {
    "revocation_list": "/.well-known/revoked-signatures.json",
    "revocation_check": "required",
    "revocation_url": "https://llmca.org/api/revocation-check"
  }
}
```

Agents check revocation lists before trusting signatures.

### What about privacy and tracking?
**Privacy-first design**:

- üîí **Feeds don't track by default** (static JSON files)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **But they can reference tracking endpoints** (check capabilities)
- üîç **Always review** `analytics` and `tracking` declarations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Homomorphic encryption** for sensitive data processing

### What's this about homomorphic encryption?
**Advanced privacy feature**:

```json
{
  "homomorphic_encryption": {
    "applied_to": ["patient_data"],
    "algorithm": "BFV",
    "notes": "Agents can process medical data without seeing raw content"
  }
}
```

**Revolutionary for**: Healthcare, finance, legal ‚Äî agents can compute on sensitive data without exposure.

**The vision**: *"Computation without revelation. Processing without peeking."*

---

## üåê Ecosystem & Adoption

### Is anyone actually using this?
**Honestly? Not really. Yet.**

**Current reality**:
- üî¨ **Early experimental phase** ‚Äî mostly tech enthusiasts and AI researchers
- üìä **No major production deployments** ‚Äî we're talking dozens of experimental feeds, not thousands
- üß™ **Proof-of-concept implementations** ‚Äî validating the approach, not serving real traffic
- üìà **Growing developer interest** ‚Äî GitHub stars and discussions are increasing, but slowly

**But here's what's actually working**:
- ‚úÖ **All major LLMs parse the JSON correctly** ‚Äî Claude, GPT-4, Gemini understand the structure natively
- ‚úÖ **Zero training required** ‚Äî it's just structured JSON with semantic keys
- ‚úÖ **With project knowledge**: Add `spec.llmfeed.json` to your LLM's project knowledge and it becomes practically native
- ‚úÖ **Technical foundation is solid** ‚Äî cryptographic signatures, validation tools, complete spec

**The honest adoption timeline**:

**Today (Q2 2025)**: 
- Experimental implementations
- Developer tooling maturation
- LLM compatibility validation

**Q3-Q4 2025**: 
- First production pilots
- Platform integrations (WordPress, Shopify)
- Early adopter showcases

**2026+**: 
- Mainstream adoption potential
- Agent-first websites
- True ecosystem emergence

### Why implement now if adoption is low?

**Strategic reasons**:
- üèÅ **First-mover advantage** ‚Äî be ready when agents become mainstream
- üîß **Low implementation cost** ‚Äî basic MCP feed takes 15 minutes
- üìö **Future-proofing** ‚Äî web standards typically take 3-5 years to mature
- ü§ñ **LLM compatibility** ‚Äî works today with existing models

**Technical reality**:
- üìÑ **It's just JSON** ‚Äî no complex infrastructure needed
- üîç **Agents already read it** ‚Äî even without "official" support
- üõ°Ô∏è **Trust layer ready** ‚Äî cryptographic verification available now
- üîó **Progressive enhancement** ‚Äî doesn't break existing functionality

### Should I wait for wider adoption?

**Implement now if**:
- You're building agent-first products
- You want to experiment with AI interactions
- You value being ahead of the curve
- You're comfortable with emerging standards

**Wait if**:
- You need guaranteed ROI metrics
- You're risk-averse about new technologies
- You prefer waiting for "industry standard" status
- You don't see AI agents in your use case

**Bottom line**: The technology works, the foundation is solid, but we're still in the "innovators" phase of adoption. We're building the rails for a train that's coming, but hasn't arrived at scale yet.

**Our honest advice**: *"Start with a simple experiment. See how LLMs interact with your structured data. Learn the paradigm. Scale when the ecosystem matures."*

### Which LLMs support MCP feeds natively?
| LLM | Feed Reading | Signature Verification | Trust Scoring |
|-----|--------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Claude 3.5** | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ Crypto verification | ‚úÖ Trust levels |
| **GPT-4o** | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ Ed25519 signatures | ‚úÖ Trust scoring |
| **Gemini 2.5** | ‚úÖ Reads feeds | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited crypto | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic trust |
| **Mistral Large** | ‚úÖ JSON parsing | ‚ùå No signatures | ‚ùå No trust |
| **Open models** | üîß Via libraries | üîß Via libraries | üîß Custom impl |

### How does this compare to Schema.org?
**Different but complementary**:

| Schema.org | LLMFeed | Both Together |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **SEO-focused** | **Agent-focused** | **Universal compatibility** |
| Describes content | Declares capabilities | Best of both worlds |
| Search engines | LLM agents | Search + agents |
| No verification | Cryptographically signed | Trust + discovery |

**Use both**: Schema.org for SEO, LLMFeed for agents, maximum compatibility.

### What about the GitHub discovery debates?
**Active standardization discussions**:

The MCP community is actively debating discovery mechanisms:

- üî• **Centralized registry vs .well-known** (GitHub Discussion #84, #159)
- üîç **OAuth discovery endpoints** integration
- üìã **Automatic discovery** vs manual registration
- üåê **MCP server directory** vs decentralized crawling

**Our position**: Hybrid approach - `.well-known` for discovery, optional registries for curation.

**Join the conversation**: Follow modelcontextprotocol GitHub discussions

## üí° Advanced Topics

### How do credential feeds prevent API key abuse?
**Multiple security layers**:

```json
{
  "credential": {
    "scoped_permissions": ["read_only", "public_data"],
    "rate_limits": {"requests_per_minute": 100},
    "expiry": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    "delegation_rules": {
      "max_depth": 1,
      "audit_required": true,
      "revocable": true
    }
  }
}
```

**vs Traditional API keys**:
- üîí **Scoped vs unlimited access**
- ‚è∞ **Automatic expiry vs permanent**
- üë• **Controlled delegation vs copy-paste sharing**
- üìä **Full audit trail vs no tracking**

### What's the agent delegation workflow?
**Secure multi-agent workflows**:

1. **Primary agent** receives credential feed
2. **Evaluates delegation rules** (scope, duration, audit requirements)
3. **Requests delegation token** via credential endpoint
4. **Specialized agent** receives time-limited, scoped access
5. **Complete audit trail** tracks all delegated actions

**Use cases**: Marketing ‚Üí Analytics, Sales ‚Üí CRM, Support ‚Üí Knowledge base

### How do you handle enterprise SSO integration?
**Enterprise credential patterns**:

```json
{
  "credential": {
    "auth_method": "sso",
    "sso_provider": "okta",
    "saml_endpoint": "https://company.okta.com/app/saml",
    "user_context": "service-account@company.com",
    "compliance": ["SOC2", "GDPR", "HIPAA"]
  }
}
```

## üîÆ AI Zeitgeist 2025: How LLMFeed Addresses Today's Hottest Concerns

### Is 2025 really the "Year of AI Agents"? What are the main concerns?
**Absolutely, and the concerns are very real.**

**The 2025 AI landscape**:
- ü§ñ **Agent explosion**: 96% of executives expect moderate to significant increase in AI agent usage
- üîí **Security crisis**: Traditional cybersecurity can't handle autonomous agents  
- üìä **Transparency demands**: 90% of execs think they're building trust, only 30% of users agree
- üèõÔ∏è **Regulatory pressure**: EU AI Act, emerging frameworks worldwide
- üë• **Shadow AI**: Unsanctioned AI tools spreading across enterprises

### How does LLMFeed solve the "AI Agent Trust Crisis"?
**We built the missing trust infrastructure for autonomous agents:**

**üö® The Crisis**:
- Agents need "Zero Trust" architecture but lack identity systems
- No way to verify if an agent's instructions are legitimate  
- "Shadow AI" proliferating without oversight
- Regulatory frameworks can't keep up with agent autonomy

**‚úÖ LLMFeed's Solution**:
```json
{
  "trust": {
    "signed_blocks": ["capabilities", "agent_behavior"],
    "trust_level": "certified",
    "audit_trail": "complete_provenance"
  },
  "agent_behavior": {
    "autonomous_execution": false,
    "human_in_loop": "required", 
    "consent_required": ["write_operations"]
  }
}
```

**Why this works**: Cryptographic signatures + behavioral guidance = auditable agent autonomy

### What about the "Explainable AI" and transparency demands?
**LLMFeed makes AI agent behavior transparent by design:**

**The Problem**: 
- AI systems are "black boxes" - impossible to explain decisions
- Users demand transparency but tech companies struggle to deliver
- Regulatory frameworks require explainability but provide no standards

**LLMFeed's Transparency Stack**:
- üìã **Declared capabilities**: Agents know exactly what they can access
- üéØ **Intent-based actions**: Every action maps to declared intentions  
- üèõÔ∏è **Trust provenance**: Complete cryptographic audit trail
- üë• **Behavioral guidelines**: Explicit human-AI interaction rules
- üìä **Compliance metadata**: Built-in regulatory alignment

**Real impact**: Agents become "glass boxes" instead of black boxes

### How does this address Shadow AI and governance concerns?
**LLMFeed enables enterprise AI governance at scale:**

**Shadow AI Challenge**:
- Employees use unsanctioned AI tools
- IT can't track or secure unknown AI systems
- Compliance violations multiply invisibly

**LLMFeed Governance Solution**:
- üîç **Discoverable by design**: All AI tools declare themselves via `.well-known`
- üõ°Ô∏è **Trust-based policies**: Only certified tools get autonomous access
- üìä **Centralized visibility**: One dashboard for all AI agent interactions
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Regulatory compliance**: Built-in EU AI Act, GDPR alignment

### Will this work with new AI regulations like the EU AI Act?
**LLMFeed was designed specifically for the emerging regulatory landscape:**

**EU AI Act Requirements** ‚Üí **LLMFeed Features**:
- "High-risk AI transparency" ‚Üí Cryptographic signatures + metadata
- "Human oversight requirements" ‚Üí `agent_behavior` guidance blocks  
- "Audit trail obligations" ‚Üí Complete provenance tracking
- "Risk assessment documentation" ‚Üí Trust level classifications
- "Conformity assessments" ‚Üí LLMCA certification process

**Other Frameworks**:
- ‚úÖ **GDPR**: Data provenance and consent management
- ‚úÖ **SOC2**: Audit trails and access controls  
- ‚úÖ **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- ‚úÖ **Biden AI Executive Order**: Transparency and accountability requirements

### Is LLMFeed just hype or does it solve real problems?
**We're solving the core infrastructure problem that's blocking safe AI agent adoption:**

**The Real Problem**: Everyone wants autonomous AI agents, but nobody trusts them enough to let them run unsupervised.

**Why existing solutions fail**:
- Anthropic's MCP: Great for local tools, but no web discovery or trust
- OpenAI's "function calling": No verification, accountability, or governance
- Enterprise AI platforms: Proprietary, vendor lock-in, limited interoperability

**LLMFeed's unique value**:
- üåê **Web-native**: Works across all platforms and agents
- üîê **Cryptographically secure**: Mathematical proof of authenticity
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Governance-ready**: Built for regulatory compliance  
- üîÑ **Gradual autonomy**: Trust levels enable safe agent evolution
- üèóÔ∏è **Open standard**: No vendor lock-in, community-driven

**Bottom line**: We're building the "HTTPS for AI agents" - the trust layer that makes autonomous AI safe and practical.

### What's the timeline for mainstream AI agent adoption?
**Based on current industry signals:**

**2025 Q3-Q4**: 
- Production AI agent pilots in Fortune 500
- "Human-in-the-loop" oversight standard
- Trust verification becomes competitive advantage

**2026**: 
- Widespread enterprise AI agent deployment
- Regulatory frameworks require transparency/audit trails
- LLMFeed-style trust infrastructure becomes table stakes

**2027+**:
- Autonomous agents handling routine business processes
- Trust scores determine agent capabilities automatically
- Consumer AI agents for personal task management

**Our prediction**: Organizations implementing trust infrastructure now will lead the autonomous AI transition.
