# Towards Homomorphic Capsules for the Agentic Web

As `.llmfeed.json` feeds gain adoption as **signed, trusted capsules** for agent interaction, a natural question arises:

👉 Could we also enable **manipulation of encrypted data** — while maintaining the integrity, trust, and context of the feed?

---

## Why it matters

A `.llmfeed.json` feed is already a **capsule**:

✅ It encapsulates a **payload**  
✅ It defines a **context**  
✅ It carries **signatures** and optionally **certifications**  
✅ It guarantees **integrity** across agent pipelines  

---

In many domains (healthcare, finance, public services), we need more:

👉 The ability to **process the capsule** — **without exposing raw data** — while maintaining:

✅ **End-to-end integrity**  
✅ **Auditability**  
✅ **Agent-friendly structure**  

---

## The role of Homomorphic Encryption

**Homomorphic encryption (HE)** offers exactly this potential:

👉 It allows computations to be performed **directly on encrypted data** — producing encrypted results, without ever decrypting intermediate states.

---

### A natural match with `.llmfeed.json`

If **feeds become the lingua franca of the Agentic Web**, adding **homomorphic fields** would enable:

- **Privacy-preserving agent pipelines**  
- **Auditable multi-agent workflows**  
- **Composable agent chains** for sensitive domains  
- **Safe cross-domain processing** without compromising trust  

---

## A draft extension

We have begun exploring a **hypothetical extension**:

```json
"homomorphic_encryption": {
  "applied_to": ["data"],
  "algorithm": "BFV",
  "public_parameters": "https://example.com/params.json",
  "notes": "Data is homomorphically encrypted to allow LLM-safe processing without exposing raw data."
}
```

---

## Certification and trust layers

A **natural evolution** of this vision is a **multi-layer trust model**:

### 1️⃣ LLMCA Certification (capsule and context)

LLMCA can certify that:

✅ The `.llmfeed.json` feed:  
→ **respects the LLMFeed standard**  
→ correctly structures the **signed capsule**  
→ has valid trust fields  
→ exposes a **verifiable agent-friendly context**  

---

### 2️⃣ FHE-specific Certification (payload encryption)

A specialized authority (e.g. Zama or equivalent) could certify that:

✅ The **homomorphically encrypted payload**:

- Follows **approved FHE algorithms**  
- Uses **safe parameters**  
- Is **processable across trusted agent pipelines**  
- Complies with domain-specific **privacy constraints**  

---

## Combined value

This **dual certification model** would enable:

✅ A `.llmfeed.json` feed that is:

- **agent-ready**  
- **cryptographically trusted**  
- **safe for privacy-preserving pipelines**  
- **traceable and auditable**  

---

In many sectors (healthcare, finance, public services), this represents a **game-changing architecture**:

→ For the first time, agents could **legally and safely process encrypted data** — inside a **trusted capsule** — across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries.

---

## Practical agentic pipelines — examples

To illustrate the potential of homomorphic capsules, here are some practical agent pipeline scenarios:

---

### 🏥 Healthcare Data Processing

**Actors:**

- **Hospital A** emits a `.llmfeed.json` of patient statistics (non-identifiable), with **homomorphic encryption** applied to `data`.
- Feed is **signed** and **LLMCA certified**.
- Payload encryption is **certified by a FHE health data authority**.

**Pipeline:**

1️⃣ Hospital A → emits `feed_type: export` with `homomorphic_encryption` on `data`.  
2️⃣ Research Agent → receives feed → performs **encrypted aggregation** (average, sum) → without decrypting.  
3️⃣ Transmits **same feed (with updated `trust` block)** to Ministry of Health agent.  
4️⃣ Ministry agent performs **further homomorphic analysis** → produces public statistical report → **without ever seeing raw data**.

---

### 💳 Financial Risk Scoring

**Actors:**

- **Bank X** emits a `credential` or `pricing` feed with **FHE-protected financial indicators**.
- Feed is **signed + certified**.
- Third-party agents perform **scoring on encrypted fields**.

**Pipeline:**

1️⃣ Bank X → emits `credential` feed.  
2️⃣ Regulatory Agent → performs **compliance checks on encrypted indicators**.  
3️⃣ Trusted Scoring Agent → computes **FHE-based risk score**.  
4️⃣ Result is **re-integrated** in the agent workflow — without raw financial data exposure.

---

### 🏛️ Public Administration — Cross-Agency Process

**Actors:**

- **Agency A** (e.g., tax) → emits an `mcp` feed with encrypted citizen profile.  
- **Agency B** (e.g., housing) → processes feed **without decrypting sensitive fields**.  
- **Agency C** (e.g., healthcare) → adds insights → without breaking the chain of trust.

**Pipeline:**

1️⃣ Agency A → emits homomorphic feed.  
2️⃣ Agencies B and C process in parallel → add metadata → forward to **central decision agent**.  
3️⃣ Final action performed → all traceable → no raw citizen data exposed.

## A call to explore

If there is **interest in the community** — researchers, implementers, agent platform builders — we are ready to:

✅ **Prototype the extension**  
✅ **Evolve the standard** to support HE as **first-class citizen**  
✅ **Partner with homomorphic encryption leaders** (Zama, we would love to talk!)  
✅ **Enable the "holy grail" of agent pipelines**:  
→ **encrypted, manipulable payloads inside a verifiable, signed, agent-friendly capsule**

---

## Next steps

We invite:

- **Researchers** in HE  
- **Agent framework builders**  
- **Privacy advocates**  
- **Regulated industry experts**  

… to help us explore this path.

**LLMCA / WellKnownMCP** is an open forum — this is the kind of extension that can define the future of **trusted agentic infrastructures**.

**Let’s build it — together.**
