# ðŸ“¢ Scraping Isnâ€™t Understanding

Web scraping has helped bridge formats for years â€” but itâ€™s fundamentally flawed for AI:

- Itâ€™s brittle  
- Itâ€™s lossy  
- Itâ€™s permission-less  
- It ignores intention

Instead, **letâ€™s declare.**

MCP and `.llmfeed.json` enable:
- Portable prompts  
- Declared tokens & fallback  
- Session context replay  
- Certified action scopes  

You donâ€™t need to guess what a page means.  
You can **say it**. And let any agent act on it.

This isnâ€™t more noise. Itâ€™s machine-usable signal.
