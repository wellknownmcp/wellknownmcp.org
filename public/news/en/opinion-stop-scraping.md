# 📢 Scraping Isn’t Understanding

---

## The Status Quo: Scrape and Guess

For years, web scraping has been a way to bridge formats:

- **Crawlers** scrape HTML  
- **SEO tools** parse pages  
- **LLMs** now ingest web snapshots and try to "understand" content  

But scraping is fundamentally flawed for **AI-based agents**:

- ❌ It’s **brittle** → structure changes break scrapers  
- ❌ It’s **lossy** → surface content is incomplete or misleading  
- ❌ It’s **permission-less** → respect for intent is missing  
- ❌ It **ignores trust** → anyone can scrape and misrepresent  

---

## Why This Fails for Agents

Agents are not search engines.

They are expected to:

✅ Interact  
✅ Act on behalf of users  
✅ Guide decisions  
✅ Respect trust boundaries  
✅ Handle dynamic, multi-turn contexts  

Scraping doesn’t provide:

❌ **Intent**  
❌ **Actionability**  
❌ **Trust model**  
❌ **Guidance for interaction**  

---

## The Alternative: Declare

Instead of **guessing**, sites can **declare**:

✅ What they offer  
✅ How they want to be used  
✅ Under what trust level  
✅ With what fallback strategies  
✅ What is signed and certified  

---

## What MCP Enables

MCP and `.llmfeed.json` introduce:

✅ **Portable prompts** → explicit interaction guidance  
✅ **Declared tokens & fallback** → usage transparency  
✅ **Session context replay** → reproducibility and auditability  
✅ **Certified action scopes** → clear boundaries of what is trusted  

---

## Why This Is Better

👉 It shifts from:

| Scraping | Declaring |
|----------|-----------|
| Guess intent | Declare intent |
| Parse surface content | Expose structured agent context |
| No trust model | Signed and certifiable |
| Fragile and lossy | Explicit and robust |
| No session awareness | Context-aware and replayable |

---

## Business and Ethical Impact

**Why should site owners and platforms adopt MCP?**

✅ **Better control** → declare how agents can interact  
✅ **Better transparency** → for regulators and users  
✅ **Better UX** → agents present trustworthy, structured options  
✅ **Less legal risk** → explicit declarations reduce scraping abuse  

---

## Example: The E-Commerce Site

Instead of letting LLMs scrape product pages blindly, a site can declare:

```json
"intent_router": {
  "default_intent": "compare products",
  "guided_intents": ["show certified prices", "list available options"],
  "fallback": "redirect to official site"
}
```

And sign it.

Agents no longer guess. They **know what’s allowed and trusted**.

---

## Final Thought: From Noise to Signal

Scraping is noise.  
Declaration is signal.

**Agents deserve signal.**  
**Users deserve trustworthy interactions.**  
**Sites deserve control.**

👉 It’s time to **stop scraping** and **start declaring**.
