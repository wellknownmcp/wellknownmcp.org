# How Agents Understand You — MCP Explained

When a human visits your website, they look for menus, keywords, and maybe a contact form.

But an agent?
It needs a structure.
It needs a declaration of what you do, how to interact, and what is trusted.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Intents

Use [`prompts`](/tools/prompts-explained) to tell agents:

- what a user might say
- what action it should trigger
- what conditions apply

No prompt engineering required. Just declared intent.

---

## 📁 Well-Known Directory

Under `/.well-known`, expose your main capsule as [`mcp.llmfeed.json`](/tools/well-known).
It contains metadata, trust, endpoints, and more — in agent-readable form.

---

## 📤 Export Buttons

Let any user or LLM export structured content from your site.
Learn more on the [`Export Button`](/tools/export-button) page.

---

## 📚 LLM Index

List all your MCP feeds for discovery via [`llm-index.llmfeed.json`](/tools/llm-index).
It acts as your sitemap — for agents.

## ✅ Conclusion

With MCP, agents don’t need to guess anymore.
They can **know** what you offer, how to call it, and why they can trust it.

It’s not magic. It’s declared.
It's time to [Join the Ecosystem](/join).
