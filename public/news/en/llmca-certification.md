Certification is not magic. It’s inspection + commitment. The LLMCA validator:
- checks canonical structure
- verifies signatures against public keys
- warns on missing metadata, orphaned references, insecure fields
- certifies only feeds that pass reproducible verification

Certified feeds are marked with trust levels (`silver`, `gold`, `curated`), enabling agents to prioritize.

Think of LLMCA as a digital public notary for your `.llmfeed.json`.
