# 🧵 Thread — What if your site could talk to LLMs?

**1/**  
🚀 We just launched [https://wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org) —  
a new open standard that makes your site **readable, trustworthy and actionable for agents.**  
Think `.well-known/` — but for **AI**.

**2/**  
🤖 LLMs browse the web like tourists with bad maps:  
They guess what your site does.  
They hallucinate APIs.  
They miss your intent.

It’s time for **clarity**.

**3/**  
With a few signed `.llmfeed.json` files, your domain becomes **agent-compatible**:

- What can an agent do here?  
- Are prompts trusted?  
- Can I act or fetch context?

It’s like a sitemap — but for agent logic.

**4/**  
📂 Key feeds you can expose:

- `mcp.llmfeed.json` → root declaration  
- `capabilities.llmfeed.json` → exposed tools or APIs  
- `prompts/` → signed prompt capsules  
- `llm-index.llmfeed.json` → bundle index for agents  

**5/**  
✅ Real use cases:

- Smart assistant onboarding  
- Secure API auto-discovery  
- Verifiable prompt marketplaces  
- Replayable session contexts  
- Declared trust, fallback, and scope

**6/**  
🧪 Try it live:

- 🛠 [Prompt Tool](https://wellknownmcp.org/tools/prompt)  
- 🌐 [Ecosystem Explorer](https://wellknownmcp.org/ecosystem)  
- 📜 [Manifesto](https://wellknownmcp.org/spec/spec/llmfeed_manifesto)

No login. No vendor lock. Just clarity.

**7/**  
💡 What is `.llmfeed.json`?

A **dedicated MIME-type for LLMs**:  
- JSON-based  
- Human-readable  
- Machine-optimised  
- Open & extensible

It works with ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, or any custom agent.

**8/**  
💬 Try this with your favorite LLM:

> “Here’s a `llmfeed.json`. Explain what this site enables.”  
> “Show me which prompts or APIs are exposed.”  
> “How would you interact with this domain?”

Yes — you can turn **any LLM into a protocol teacher**.

**9/**
