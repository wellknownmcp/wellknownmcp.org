Want to make your site agent-ready today? You only need:

1. A `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` with at least:
    - `metadata`, `feed_type`, `intent_router`
2. An optional prompt or `agent_guidance`
3. A free tool to sign it: [Forge](https://llmfeedforge.org)

You donâ€™t need to be an AI engineer. You just need intent.
