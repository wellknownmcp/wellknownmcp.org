Most sites have hundreds of endpoints. Agents don‚Äôt want to crawl, they want direction.

The `llm-index.llmfeed.json` offers a summarized view of key capsules:
- News, tools, APIs, exports, prompts
- Grouped by intent, format, language
- Signed and optionally certified

It‚Äôs the sitemap for LLMs ‚Äî but smarter, with agent-ready structure and fewer dead ends.
