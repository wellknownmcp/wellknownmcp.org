The `ExportToLLM` button is deceptively simple: one click, and the current page becomes a structured, shareable capsule â€” designed to be ingested by a model.

This isnâ€™t just export. Itâ€™s *intention export*. Every capsule includes:
- origin, trust level, timestamp
- data block (cleaned Markdown, HTML, API, code, etc.)
- optional prompts or instructions

Any LLM can read it. Any agent can act on it. And you control what they see.
