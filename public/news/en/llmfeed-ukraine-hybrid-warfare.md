# Securing Agentic Pipelines in Hybrid Warfare — The LLMFeed Perspective

The war in Ukraine has become a laboratory for **hybrid warfare** — where autonomous agents, drones, AI-driven systems, and cyber operations play an increasingly central role.

In this new operational landscape, one of the key challenges is to ensure the **trustworthiness of agentic communications**:

👉 How can autonomous agents (drones, targeting systems, decision-support AIs) trust that a command, a target coordinate, or a situational update is **genuine** and **integrity-preserved**?

---

## The risk: corrupted pipelines

In hybrid warfare, pipelines of agentic interaction are highly vulnerable:

- Spoofed orders  
- Falsified targeting data  
- Hijacked session state  
- Broken chains of command between AIs and autonomous systems  

Without a robust **verifiable standard for agentic communications**, there is a high risk of:

- Autonomous fratricide  
- Misuse of drones based on falsified data  
- Tactical disruption by cyber forces  

---

## Why `.llmfeed.json` matters

LLMFeed was not designed as a military protocol — but its core properties are **directly applicable**:

✅ Signed feeds → cryptographic **integrity**  
✅ Explicit `trust` and `signed_blocks` → prevent decoupling of payload and context  
✅ `certification` → verify source (e.g. unit, command authority)  
✅ `session_state` → ensure coherence across distributed agents  
✅ Standard JSON → easily parsed by a wide variety of agents (LLM, embedded, drone firmware, C2 systems)

---

## Example scenarios — as seen in Ukraine

### 1️⃣ Coordinating drones and AI recon agents

A reconnaissance AI identifies a target:

```json
"intent": "target_update",
"data": {
  "coordinates": "...",
  "visual_match": "...",
  "time": "..."
},
"trust": { "signed_blocks": ["intent", "data", "metadata"] },
"certification": { "unit": "UA Recon 24th Brigade" }
```

✅ The drone receiving this feed can **verify**:

- that the target data is authentic

- that it comes from an authorized source

- that its context (time, origin) cannot be spoofed

---

### 2️⃣ Secure AI-to-AI tactical updates

Command AI → field AI:

json

CopierModifier

`"intent": "path_recalculation", "session_state": { ... }, "trust": { "signed_blocks": ["intent", "session_state"] }`

✅ Guarantees that:

- **no MITM** can insert a falsified update

- session continuity is preserved

---

## Why an open standard is key

In a theater of hybrid warfare, proprietary protocols cannot scale:

- Many actors

- Many types of agents

- Many interop layers (NATO / UA / NGOs / open-source drone makers)

An **open, signed, verifiable format** like `.llmfeed.json` provides:

✅ cross-agent compatibility  
✅ auditability (legal, ethical)  
✅ resilience against cyber disruption  
✅ ability to verify sources **at the agent level** (even on-device)

## Call to the community

LLMCA / WellKnownMCP welcomes the exploration of **ethical defense use cases** for LLMFeed.

We believe that:

👉 **Securing agentic pipelines in warfare is not optional**  
👉 Open standards are better than proprietary, opaque solutions  
👉 Trust and verification mechanisms must be **transparent** and **auditable**

---

## Standing with Ukraine

We also acknowledge that Ukraine is today **leading globally** in this new type of warfare — where:

- drones

- AI reconnaissance

- autonomous systems

- human-in-the-loop decision aids

are all interacting on a **hybrid battlefield**.

If `.llmfeed.json` can help **secure these pipelines**, we are ready to support.

👉 Let's explore it — together.
