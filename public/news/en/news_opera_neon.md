# üß† Opera Neon Relaunch: A Step Forward for the Agentic Web?

On May 28, 2025, Opera announced the relaunch of **Opera Neon**, its experimental browser, now branded as *‚Äúthe first agentic browser.‚Äù*

## A New Vision for Browsing

Eight years after its original prototype (2017), Opera Neon returns with a concept fully centered on native AI agent integration. The browser now offers three usage modes:

- **Chat**: an integrated AI assistant for interacting with web content and generating text.
- **Do**: an agent capable of performing autonomous actions on websites (reservations, purchases, form automation).
- **Make**: a content generation engine (sites, documents, code), capable of working in the background.

## Privacy and Local Execution

Unlike many cloud-based solutions, **Neon prioritizes local execution** of agents, interacting directly with the page DOM. This enables faster and more privacy-friendly operations.

## Links to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

While Opera‚Äôs announcement does not yet explicitly mention open standards such as **MCP** or **LLMFeed**, Neon‚Äôs positioning aligns closely with the philosophy of the Agentic Web:

‚úÖ **Interoperability**: allowing agents to interact with any website.  
‚úÖ **Verifiable automation**: potential to expose site capabilities and intent (cf. MCP `intent_router` and `capabilities` blocks).  
‚úÖ **Standards-friendly**: an opportunity to natively support `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`, enabling Neon agents to detect agentic interfaces on a site.

## Structural Impact?

The relaunch of Neon has several implications for our ecosystem:

1. **Raising awareness**: Opera brings the concept of the Agentic Browser into the mainstream.
2. **Validating the need for standards**: for these agents to interact safely and properly with the web, robust standards are needed ‚Äî this is exactly the purpose of the **Model Context Protocol**.
3. **New target for MCP implementations**: MCP-compliant sites can now consider targeting Neon agents alongside traditional LLMs.
4. **Reinforcing the shift toward agent-aware SEO**: initiatives like [aiovsseo.com](https://aiovsseo.com) already explore how SEO strategies must adapt to agentic interactions, where AI-driven agents replace traditional human browsing flows.

## Other Agentic Browser Initiatives

The agentic web landscape is rapidly evolving, with several notable initiatives:

- **Google Chrome with Gemini Integration**: Google's Chrome browser now features Gemini, an AI-powered assistant capable of summarizing articles, identifying objects in videos, and assisting with product searches. This integration is part of Google's broader strategy to create more "agentic" AI tools, aiming to enhance user interaction with web content.

- **Microsoft's NLWeb Protocol**: At Build 2025, Microsoft unveiled its roadmap for an ‚Äúopen agentic web,‚Äù launching an extensive suite of AI updates including GitHub Copilot enhancements, a new AI browser agent, Copilot Studio, Azure Foundry, and more.

- **OpenAI's Operator**: OpenAI has introduced a "research preview" of an AI agent called Operator, designed to perform web tasks on behalf of users. Operator can fill out forms, order products, make reservations, and more by utilizing a web browser to execute clicks and typing tasks just like a human user.

- **Magical Chrome Extension**: Magical represents the cutting edge of AI automation with its fully agentic approach. Unlike traditional automation tools that follow rigid, predefined rules, Magical uses advanced reasoning models to make decisions just like a human would. This allows it to handle complex processes effortlessly and adapt to changes on the fly.

- **LiteWebAgent**: We introduce LiteWebAgent, an open-source suite for VLM-based web agent applications. Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search.

## Conclusion

The return of **Opera Neon** is positive news for Agentic Web advocates. It signals that browsers are beginning to adapt to this emerging paradigm, where agents play an active role.

**At wellknownmcp.org, we will be closely monitoring Neon‚Äôs evolution** and encourage the community to prepare for these new interactions by exposing fully-formed MCP feeds today.
