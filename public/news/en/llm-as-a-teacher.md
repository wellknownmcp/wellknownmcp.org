# 🧠 Use LLMs to Understand the Standard

One of the unique advantages of the `.llmfeed.json` format is that it is **understandable by LLMs themselves**.

You can feed it directly to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or others and use the following prompts:

- “Explain this feed to me block by block”  
- “Does this feed look trustworthy?”  
- “Which blocks are signed or certified?”  
- “How could I improve it?”  
- “Write me a valid llmfeed.json with prompt + trust + signature”

LLMs can become:
- 🧑‍🏫 Teachers (explain structure, purpose, usage)
- 🕵️ Auditors (check compliance, point out weaknesses)
- 🤖 Publishers (generate new feeds from content or patterns)

This is **not a side benefit** — it’s core to the MCP vision.
