# How ChatGPT Browses the Internet: What You Need to Know

*Ever wonder how ChatGPT "reads" your website? Or why Claude sometimes gets things totally wrong about your business? Here's what's really happening.*

## The Questions Everyone's Asking

### "How does ChatGPT browse the internet?"

**Short answer:** ChatGPT doesn't "browse" like you do. It can't see your website the way you see it.

**What actually happens:**
- ChatGPT requests your webpage (just the basic HTML text)
- It can't see images, videos, or anything that loads with JavaScript
- It reads the raw text and tries to guess what your site does
- Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes it doesn't

**Think of it like this:** Imagine trying to understand a restaurant by only reading the ingredients list, not seeing the menu or photos.

### "Is Claude reading my website right now?"

**Short answer:** Only when someone asks it to. Claude doesn't crawl websites automatically.

**What Claude actually does:**
- When you ask "What does example.com do?", Claude visits that specific page
- It reads the text content (no images, no interactive stuff)
- It tries to understand your business from whatever text it finds
- It gives you an answer based on that limited information

**The problem:** If your website doesn't clearly explain what you do in plain text, Claude will guess. And guesses can be wrong.

### "What is Brave Search that I see with Claude?"

**Short answer:** It's a search engine that Claude uses to find recent information.

**How it works:**
- When Claude needs current info, it searches the web using Brave Search
- Brave Search returns a list of websites related to your question
- Claude then visits those specific sites to read them
- It combines what it learns to answer your question

**Why Brave and not Google?** Different AI companies use different search engines. Claude uses Brave Search because it focuses on privacy and doesn't track users.

### "Does Gemini use Chrome to browse websites?"

**Short answer:** No, Gemini doesn't use Chrome like a human would.

**What Gemini actually does:**
- Google's Gemini has special access to Google's web index
- It can also request web pages directly when needed
- It doesn't need to "browse" because Google already knows about most websites
- But it still faces the same problem: understanding what sites actually do

## The Real Problem: AI Can't Really "See" Your Website

### What AI Sees vs. What You See

**Your website to humans:**
- Beautiful design and images
- Clear navigation menus
- Call-to-action buttons
- Videos and interactive content
- Professional layout

**Your website to AI:**
- Plain text with some formatting
- No images (just alt text if you have it)
- No JavaScript functionality
- No visual design elements
- Just words on a page

### Why AI Gets Things Wrong

**Example: A Restaurant Website**

```html
<!-- What your website shows humans -->
<div class="hero-banner">
  <img src="delicious-pizza.jpg" alt="pizza">
  <h1>Welcome to Tony's</h1>
  <button>Order Now</button>
</div>
```

**What AI actually reads:**
```
Welcome to Tony's
(maybe "pizza" if you have good alt text)
```

**Result:** AI might think Tony's is a general business, not specifically a pizza restaurant.

### Real Examples of AI Confusion

**Website:** Professional photography studio  
**AI reads:** "Capturing moments that matter"  
**AI thinks:** Could be wedding planning, therapy, or life coaching  
**Reality:** AI has no idea you take photos

**Website:** SaaS project management tool  
**AI reads:** "Streamline your workflow"  
**AI thinks:** Could be consulting, software, or business coaching  
**Reality:** AI doesn't know you're a specific tool with specific features

## The Simple Solution: Tell AI What You Do

### The Old Way: Hope AI Figures It Out

Most websites are built for humans, hoping AI will somehow understand. This leads to:
- AI giving wrong recommendations about your business
- Potential customers getting confused information
- Lost opportunities when AI misrepresents you

### The New Way: Speak AI's Language

Smart websites now include a simple file that tells AI exactly what they do:

```json
{
  "intent": "professional_photography_for_weddings_and_events",
  "services": ["wedding_photography", "event_photography", "portrait_sessions"],
  "location": "downtown_seattle_washington",
  "contact_preference": "phone_consultation_required"
}
```

**This is called LLMFeed** - a simple way to tell AI what your website actually does.

## How Different AI Systems Browse the Web

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

**Method:** Direct page requests  
**Frequency:** Only when asked by users  
**What it sees:** HTML text, no JavaScript  
**Special features:** Can browse multiple pages in one conversation  

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "What does acmecorp.com do?"
ChatGPT: [Visits acmecorp.com]
ChatGPT: [Reads HTML text]
ChatGPT: "Based on the website, Acme Corp appears to be..."
```

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Method:** Search + page reading  
**Search engine:** Brave Search  
**What it sees:** HTML text, focuses on main content  
**Special features:** Good at understanding context across multiple sources  

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Find me a good CRM for small business"
Claude: [Searches Brave for "small business CRM"]
Claude: [Visits top results]
Claude: [Analyzes multiple websites]
Claude: "I found several options..."
```

### Gemini (Google)

**Method:** Google's web index + direct access  
**Search engine:** Google (obviously)  
**What it sees:** Benefits from Google's web crawling data  
**Special features:** Integrated with Google's knowledge about websites  

### Other AI Systems

**Perplexity:** Focuses on real-time search and source citations  
**You.com:** Combines search with AI understanding  
**Bing AI:** Uses Microsoft's Bing search index  

**Common pattern:** They all face the same basic limitation - they can only read text, not truly "see" your website like humans do.

## Try This Right Now: See LLMFeed in Action

### The "Aha Moment" Test

**Don't take our word for it. Try this experiment:**

#### Test 1: Ask Any AI This Exact Question
```
"What is wellknownmcp.org and does it worth attention and time?"
```

**Go ahead, try it with:**
- ChatGPT: [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
- Claude: [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)  
- Perplexity: [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)

**What you'll discover:** The AI will give you a detailed, accurate answer about LLMFeed, the Model Context Protocol, and exactly why it matters for your website.

**Why this works:** wellknownmcp.org uses LLMFeed to tell AI exactly what it does, so you get precise information instead of guessing.

#### Test 2: The Deep Search Challenge
```
"deep search llmfeed implementation examples"
```

**What happens:** Watch how AI finds specific implementation examples, use cases, and technical details without getting confused or giving vague answers.

**The difference:** Compare this to asking about a random website. You'll see how much clearer and more useful the AI's response is when a site "speaks AI language."

#### Test 3: Compare Any Business Website
Pick any local business website and ask:
```
"What does [business-website.com] do and how can they help me?"
```

**Then ask about wellknownmcp.org:**
```
"What does wellknownmcp.org do and how can they help me?"
```

**You'll see the difference immediately:**
- Random business: Vague, confused, or wrong information
- wellknownmcp.org: Specific, accurate, helpful details

### The "Before and After" Reality Check

#### Try This With Your Own Website

**Step 1:** Ask ChatGPT or Claude about your website right now
**Step 2:** Notice what they get wrong or miss completely  
**Step 3:** Imagine if they gave perfect, accurate answers instead

**Real example from a restaurant owner:**

**Before LLMFeed:**
```
User: "Tell me about Tony's Pizza on Main Street"
AI: "I don't have current information about Tony's Pizza. You might want to check their website or call them directly."
```

**After LLMFeed:**
```
User: "Tell me about Tony's Pizza on Main Street" 
AI: "Tony's Pizza is a family-owned Italian restaurant specializing in wood-fired pizza and homemade pasta. They offer dine-in, takeout, and delivery within downtown Seattle. They're known for their authentic recipes and have gluten-free options available."
```

**The owner's reaction:** "Holy shit, that's exactly what I want people to know about my restaurant!"

## Why Your Website Might Be "Invisible" to AI

### Common Problems

#### 1. Everything Important is in Images
```html
<!-- AI can't read this -->
<img src="our-services-infographic.jpg">

<!-- AI can read this -->
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wedding Photography</li>
  <li>Corporate Events</li>
  <li>Family Portraits</li>
</ul>
```

#### 2. Content Hidden Behind JavaScript
```html
<!-- AI can't see this -->
<div id="services"></div>
<script>
// Services loaded with JavaScript
loadServices();
</script>

<!-- AI can see this -->
<div>
  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>We provide wedding photography...</p>
</div>
```

#### 3. Vague Business Language
```html
<!-- Confusing to AI -->
<h1>Transforming Your Digital Journey</h1>
<p>We leverage innovative solutions...</p>

<!-- Clear to AI -->
<h1>WordPress Website Design for Small Businesses</h1>
<p>We build custom WordPress websites...</p>
```

## Sitemap vs. LLMFeed: What's the Difference?

### Traditional Sitemap (sitemap.xml)

**Purpose:** Tell Google which pages exist  
**Format:** List of URLs with basic info  
**For:** Search engine crawlers  
**Content example:**
```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://yoursite.com/about</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-01-15</lastmod>
</url>
```

**What AI gets:** Just knows the page exists, still has to guess what it's about

### LLMFeed (New Approach)

**Purpose:** Tell AI what your site actually does  
**Format:** Structured information about your business  
**For:** AI agents like ChatGPT and Claude  
**Content example:**
```json
{
  "business_type": "wedding_photography",
  "services": ["ceremony_photos", "reception_photos", "engagement_sessions"],
  "coverage_area": "seattle_metro_area",
  "booking_process": "consultation_required"
}
```

**What AI gets:** Clear understanding of your business without guessing

### The Key Difference

**Sitemap:** "Here are my pages"  
**LLMFeed:** "Here's what I actually do and how I help people"

## Simple Steps to Make Your Site AI-Friendly

### Step 1: Test Your Site with AI

Ask ChatGPT or Claude: "What does [yoursite.com] do?"

Notice what they get right and what they get wrong.

### Step 2: Make Your Text Clear

Replace vague language with specific descriptions:

❌ "Innovative solutions for modern challenges"  
✅ "WordPress websites for restaurants and cafes"

❌ "Transforming businesses through technology"  
✅ "Online ordering systems for local restaurants"

### Step 3: Add a Simple LLMFeed File

Create a file that tells AI exactly what you do:

```json
{
  "feed_type": "mcp",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Your Business Name",
    "description": "Specific description of what you do"
  },
  "data": {
    "intent": "primary_service_you_provide",
    "target_audience": "who_you_help",
    "location": "where_you_operate",
    "contact_method": "how_people_should_reach_you"
  }
}
```

Save this as `/.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` on your website.

### Step 4: Test Again

Ask the AI the same question and see if the answer improved.

## Why This Matters for Your Business

### Better AI Recommendations

When people ask AI for recommendations in your industry, you want to be suggested accurately, not ignored or misrepresented.

**Before LLMFeed:**
```
User: "Find me a wedding photographer in Seattle"
AI: "I found several photographers in Seattle. You should contact them to see if they do weddings."
```

**After LLMFeed:**
```
User: "Find me a wedding photographer in Seattle"
AI: "Sarah's Photography specializes in weddings in the Seattle area. They offer ceremony, reception, and engagement packages. You can book a consultation through their website."
```

### Reduce Customer Confusion

When AI misunderstands your business, potential customers get wrong information before they even contact you.

### Future-Proof Your Website

More people are using AI to research businesses. Making your site AI-friendly now gives you an advantage as this trend grows.

## Common Questions About AI Web Browsing

### "Can ChatGPT see my website's design?"

No. ChatGPT only reads the text content of your pages. It can't see colors, layouts, images, or visual design elements.

### "Why does Claude sometimes give outdated information about my business?"

Because Claude reads whatever text is currently on your website. If your website doesn't mention your latest services or recent changes, Claude won't know about them.

### "Does Gemini browse better because it's made by Google?"

Gemini has access to Google's knowledge about websites, but it still faces the same limitation when reading new or updated content - it can only see text, not visual elements.

### "Can AI see my website's images?"

AI can read "alt text" descriptions of images, but it can't actually see the images themselves. If important information is only in images, AI will miss it completely.

### "How often does AI visit my website?"

AI doesn't visit your website automatically. It only visits when a user specifically asks about your site or when searching for information related to your business.

## The Ultimate Proof: Test These Websites Right Now

### See the Difference Yourself

Don't just read about it - experience the difference by testing these exact queries with any AI:

#### Query Set 1: LLMFeed vs. Regular Websites
```
"Compare wellknownmcp.org capabilities versus any random business website"
```

**What you'll notice:**
- wellknownmcp.org: AI gives specific, detailed, accurate information
- Random business site: AI gives vague guesses or admits confusion

#### Query Set 2: Deep Technical Understanding
```
"Explain the technical implementation of LLMFeed and give me examples"
```

**Result:** AI will walk you through exactly how to implement LLMFeed on your site, with working code examples.

**Why this works:** The technical documentation is structured specifically for AI understanding.

#### Query Set 3: Business Value Assessment
```
"Is wellknownmcp worth my time as a business owner? Give me pros and cons."
```

**What happens:** AI gives you a balanced, informed analysis because it can access the complete context about what LLMFeed actually does and why it matters.

#### Query Set 4: Implementation Reality Check
```
"How hard is it to implement LLMFeed and what tools are available?"
```

**Expected response:** Specific tools, time estimates, difficulty levels, and step-by-step guidance - because the AI can access this information directly.

### The "Competitor Test"

**Try this experiment:**

1. **Pick 3 competitors in your industry**
2. **Ask AI:** "What does [competitor1.com] do?"
3. **Ask AI:** "What does [competitor2.com] do?"
4. **Ask AI:** "What does [competitor3.com] do?"

**Then ask yourself:**
- Which competitors got accurate descriptions?
- Which ones got vague or wrong information?
- If a potential customer asked AI for recommendations in your industry, who would get recommended accurately?

**The reality:** Competitors with clear, AI-readable information have a massive advantage in AI-mediated recommendations.

### Challenge: Test Your Industry

**Pick any of these searches and see what AI finds:**

**For Restaurants:**
```
"Find me the best pizza place in [your city] that offers gluten-free options"
```

**For Services:**
```
"I need a plumber who does emergency service in [your area]"
```

**For Retail:**
```
"Where can I buy hiking boots with good customer service in [your city]?"
```

**Notice:**
- Which businesses get recommended?

### For the Future

As more people use AI to find businesses and services, having an AI-friendly website becomes as important as having a mobile-friendly website was 10 years ago.

**The early adopters will have the advantage** while everyone else is still figuring this out.

### The "Convert or Lose" Reality

**Here's what's happening right now:**

Every day, people ask AI:
- "Find me a good [your type of business]"
- "What's the best [your service] in [your area]"
- "Compare different [your industry] options"

**If your website can't be understood by AI, you're not just invisible - you're losing business to competitors who can be understood.**

**The test results don't lie.** Try the queries yourself and see which businesses get accurate, helpful recommendations.

## Summary: The Simple Truth

**How AI really browses the web:**
- AI can only read text, not see visual design
- Different AI systems use different methods, but all have the same limitations
- AI often guesses what your business does based on limited information

**Why this matters:**
- Wrong AI descriptions can hurt your business
- People increasingly use AI to research companies
- Making your site AI-friendly is easier than you think

**What you can do:**
- Test your site with AI tools
- Make your text content clear and specific
- Add a simple LLMFeed file to tell AI exactly what you do

**Bottom line:** AI web browsing isn't magic. It's actually quite limited. But understanding how it works lets you make sure AI represents your business accurately.
