# Meta’s Open Agents: Opportunity or Challenge for MCP?

During Meta Connect 2025, Meta introduced **Open Agents** — a framework to enable third-party developers to create agents that can operate across Meta’s platforms: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the broader web.

This initiative is framed as a step toward *agentic interoperability*. But as always with Meta, the question is: how open is *Open Agents* really?

## What is the promise?

Meta claims that Open Agents will:
- Allow agents to interact with Meta properties via standard APIs.
- Support cross-platform discovery and invocation.
- Be extensible to third-party services “on the open web.”

This last point is where things get interesting for proponents of the **Agentic Web**.

## Alignment with MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** provides a neutral, verifiable way for agents to:
- Discover capabilities of a service (`.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`).
- Understand trust models.
- Interact in a secure and auditable manner.

If Meta’s Open Agents truly embrace MCP, it could:
- Standardize *agent-to-service interactions* across a vast portion of the web.
- Accelerate adoption of MCP as a **cross-industry baseline**.
- Help avoid the emergence of *walled garden agent ecosystems*.

## Early signs

So far:
- Meta’s technical docs mention `.well-known` endpoints but do not explicitly reference MCP (yet).
- The agent manifest format shows partial overlap with MCP metadata.
- Discussions are ongoing with standards bodies, including W3C and independent groups like [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org).

## Our take

Meta’s involvement could be a *double-edged sword*:  
If done well, Open Agents could legitimize and mainstream **Agentic Web standards**.  
If done poorly (proprietary lock-in), it could fragment the ecosystem.

**Community engagement will be key.** The open-source and standards communities must push for:
- True alignment with **MCP and open verification models**.
- Interoperability beyond Meta’s ecosystem.
- Agent trust and consent mechanisms that empower users, not platforms.

**We will continue to monitor this space** — and invite Meta’s teams to engage with the [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org) community to ensure that **Open Agents serves the open Agentic Web, not just corporate interests**.

Stay tuned.
