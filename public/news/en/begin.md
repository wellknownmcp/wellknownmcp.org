# 👋 Welcome to WellKnownMCP

This page is your **entry point** to understanding the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and its core unit: the `llmfeed.json`.

Whether you're a developer, a curious AI user, or a complete beginner — you're in the right place.

---

## 🚀 Why this matters

Language Models are no longer passive.  
They **read**, **crawl**, and even **act**.

But the web isn’t built for them.  
It’s full of visuals, scripts, and content made for humans — not agents.

We propose a new layer:  
📂 `.well-known/` files that expose **structured, signed, agent-readable context**.

---

## 🧠 What is a `.llmfeed.json`?

A `llmfeed.json` is a minimal, flexible JSON format that any LLM can read.  
It’s not a closed format — it's a **canon**:

- Human-writable  
- Machine-optimised  
- Agent-readable  
- Open and extendable

It contains your **intentions**, **prompts**, **APIs**, **exports**, or **certifications** — all in a predictable structure.

---

## ✨ What makes it special?

- ✅ Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, etc.  
- ✅ Can be **signed** (by you) or **certified** (by an authority like `llmca.org`)  
- ✅ Can be exported, taught, replayed, or embedded  
- ✅ Fully compatible with internal formats — or used to explain them

It’s the **MIME-type** of intent for agents.

## 🧰 Want to learn by doing?

Any feed or tool on this site can be **downloaded as `.llmfeed.json`**.

You can:
- 📥 Download it
- 🤖 Feed it to ChatGPT, Claude, or your favorite LLM
- 📚 Turn any agent into your **teacher or explainer**

> “Explain this feed to me”  
> “What can I do with it?”  
> “How should an agent behave?”

Just paste it in.

## 📁 Key Concepts

- [`/.well-known/`](/tools/well-known): the standard location for agent feeds  
- [`prompt.llmfeed.json`](/tools/prompts-explained): how to structure signed prompts  
- [`export.llmfeed.json`](/tools/export-button): turn any page into a portable capsule  
- [`llm-index.llmfeed.json`](/tools/llm-index): list your feeds for discovery

## 🧑‍🏫 You don't need to be a developer

Our tools work with:
- Guided UI (Forge)
- No-code export buttons
- Open-source templates

---

## ✅ TL;DR

- MCP is the missing bridge between your intent and agent understanding.  
- `llmfeed.json` is your universal format.  
- Start small. Publish one. See how far it goes.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Ask an agent to teach you

You can even start learning **by asking your LLM**:

> “Here’s a `llmfeed.json`. Explain it to me.”  
> “Show me what this site offers for agents.”  
> “Could I make my site compliant?”

Most LLMs will understand.  
The best ones will help you implement it.
