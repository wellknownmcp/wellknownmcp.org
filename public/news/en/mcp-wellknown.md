`.well-known/` is where modern protocols (OAuth, Webfinger, OpenID, security.txt‚Ä¶) declare machine-consumable context. In a world of LLMs, it's the natural gateway.

LLMFeed doesn‚Äôt replace HTML ‚Äî it supplements it with trust, structure, and intent. Placing it in `.well-known/` means:
- it can be discovered by any crawler, agent, or assistant
- it does not interfere with frontend routing
- it follows open standards and cross-domain conventions

A certified `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` is a declaration: *‚ÄúThis site is agent-ready. Ask me anything.‚Äù*
