# LLM SEO vs MCP: Competing or Complementary Visions?

As large language models (LLMs) become the new *interface to knowledge*, a new field is booming: **LLM SEO** — optimizing content not for search engines, but for AI agents.

Agencies and tools are now promising:
- Better visibility in LLM answers.
- Optimized prompt targeting.
- Structured content for better parsing.

But is this compatible with the vision of an **Agentic Web** based on open, transparent standards like MCP?

## The rise of LLM SEO

LLM SEO techniques include:
- Optimizing headings and context windows.
- Embedding structured data and semantic cues.
- Testing outputs across multiple LLM platforms.

Some practices are positive (clarifying content structure), but others risk **gaming opaque systems** — exactly the problem SEO was meant to avoid.

## The MCP alternative

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** offers a fundamentally different approach:
- Sites expose **intentional, signed metadata** about their capabilities and trust models.
- Agents consume this data via `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json`.
- Interactions are **transparent and verifiable**.

Rather than trying to guess how an LLM might interpret a page, MCP lets service owners clearly declare:
- What they offer.
- How they expect to be engaged.
- Under what trust assumptions.

## Complementary, not competing

Ideally, LLM SEO and MCP should not compete but complement each other:
- **Content optimization** improves human and agent readability.
- **MCP feeds** provide machine-verifiable context and interaction guidelines.

The risk is if LLM SEO evolves into a **black-hat practice** — manipulating LLMs in ways that undermine trust and transparency.

## Our take

The future of the Agentic Web must prioritize:
- **Verifiability over trickery.**
- **Transparent intent** over opaque optimization.
- **Open standards** over platform-specific hacks.

At [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org), we see MCP as a necessary counterpart to emerging LLM SEO — ensuring that agents interact **ethically and transparently** with the web.

**Next steps:** We invite SEO practitioners and tool makers to engage with the MCP community — and help build a **healthier, more accountable Agentic Web**.
