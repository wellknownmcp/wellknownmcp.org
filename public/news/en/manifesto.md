# üß≠ The WellKnownMCP Manifesto

## Our Vision

We believe the future of digital interaction depends on **open, explicit, agent-readable standards**.

As LLMs, copilots and agents become part of everyday digital life, we must design for **clarity**, not guesswork.  
For **trust**, not opacity.  
For **interoperability**, not fragmentation.

That‚Äôs what **WellKnownMCP** sets out to do:
- Let any domain **declare what it offers**
- Let any agent **verify, interpret, and interact with trust**
- Let any human **inspect, publish, and extend the protocol**

## üîç Our Core Values

### 1. **Absolute Transparency**
We believe that every `.llmfeed.json` capsule should clearly declare its intent, contents, and trust status.

Agents should never rely on hallucination or scraping.  
They should rely on **structured declarations**.

### 2. **Universal Interoperability**
We reject the idea that every app needs custom code to speak to every LLM.

Instead, we expose a **common language**:  
- Open-source  
- Human-readable  
- Agent-usable  
- Already interpreted by top LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

### 3. **Pragmatic Minimalism**
Our standard is designed to be:
- Simple to adopt  
- Easy to validate  
- Usable without backend logic  
- Compatible with existing tools and platforms

You can start with a single `.llmfeed.json` file.  
And grow from there.

## üß† Ethics by Design

MCP is **open** ‚Äî but not **neutral**.

It encodes:
- Trust instead of obscurity  
- Consent instead of default collection  
- Identity without surveillance  
- Portability without platform lock-in

Every feed, every export, every agent interaction **carries an ethical fingerprint**.  
That fingerprint is yours.

---

## ‚úä Our Commitments

We are committed to:

- **Transparency**  
  Declaring all intentions, capabilities, and limitations in the feeds and indexes.

- **Accountability**  
  Verifiable signatures, clear trust scopes, and certifiable content blocks.

- **Privacy and Security**  
  Minimizing data collection, maximizing clarity, supporting scoped access and consent flags.

- **Open Dialogue**  
  We invite civic actors, researchers, platforms and developers to critique and improve the protocol.

## üå± Adoption Without Friction

You don‚Äôt need a server.  
You don‚Äôt need to register.  
You don‚Äôt need a specific LLM.

You just need to expose a file: `.well-known/llmfeed.json`

Start small.  
Sign it if you want.  
Certify it if you need.  
Update it as you grow.

## üîó The Web Was Meant to Be Inspectable

We believe in a web that:
- Declares what it is
- Shares what it knows
- Makes its intentions explicit

This manifesto is not a final declaration.  
It‚Äôs a living guide ‚Äî and a call to build a **softer, agent-readable web**.
