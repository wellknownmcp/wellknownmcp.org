Schema.org was designed for webmasters. LLMFeed is for agents.

Schema.org describes whatâ€™s on a page. LLMFeed declares *what this feed wants the agent to do*, and *what can be trusted*.

Instead of `type: Article`, you get:
- `intent_router`
- `agent_guidance`
- prompts, certifier trust, fallback logic

This is not metadata. This is agent context.
