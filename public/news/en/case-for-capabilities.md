The `site_capabilities` block is a declaration of:
- Is this site LLM-readable?
- Are its feeds signed? Certified?
- What level of trust should I assign?

Agents donâ€™t want to infer. They want to verify.

Capabilities are simple, declarative booleans. But their impact is huge: they allow agents to triage, filter, prioritize, and respect site design without scraping or guessing.
