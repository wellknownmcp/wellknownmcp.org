# Claude 4.5 and the New Wave of LLM Crawling

Anthropic’s recent release of **Claude 4.5** introduces major improvements to its browsing and *LLM crawling* capabilities. More than just a chatbot, Claude is now being positioned as an **active agent** that can autonomously navigate and interact with the web.

## What’s new?

Claude 4.5 features:
- More advanced parsing of structured data.
- Enhanced handling of `.well-known` endpoints.
- Ability to respect robots.txt and emerging *LLM crawling standards*.
- Early support for *agent trust signals*.

## Why it matters for the Agentic Web

The **Agentic Web** envisions agents (LLMs, AI assistants, bots) that can:
- Safely discover and interact with services.
- Understand service capabilities and trust models.
- Respect publisher intent and user consent.

This is exactly what **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is designed for:
- A standard `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` exposes verifiable metadata.
- Signed feeds allow agents to trust what they consume.
- Capabilities declarations inform how agents should interact.

## How does Claude 4.5 align?

Anthropic has not officially endorsed MCP (yet), but:
- Claude 4.5 recognizes `.well-known/` patterns.
- It is part of industry discussions on **agent crawling etiquette**.
- Its roadmap mentions **trust-aware browsing** — a core MCP concern.

## Risks and opportunities

The emergence of **LLM-first crawlers** like Claude 4.5 raises key questions:
- Will they respect open standards or create proprietary ecosystems?
- How will they handle **content attribution and verification**?
- Will they expose enough signals for service owners to manage interactions?

## Our take

Claude 4.5 is an exciting step toward a more **agentic** web — but only if:
- Open standards like MCP are adopted and respected.
- Crawlers provide transparency and auditability.
- Service owners and users retain meaningful control.

At [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org), we believe **MCP can be the foundation** for a healthy, verifiable Agentic Web — one where LLMs like Claude 4.5 play fair.

**Next steps:** We’ll continue engaging with the Anthropic community to promote **MCP alignment** — and encourage other LLM providers to do the same.

Stay tuned!
