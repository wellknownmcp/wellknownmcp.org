🌐 Just launched: [**wellknownmcp.org**](https://wellknownmcp.org)

Give your website a voice.  
Make it **readable by agents**, **verifiable by LLMs**, and **trustable by design** — with nothing but a simple JSON file.

---

## 🧠 What is it?

We define **`.llmfeed.json`** — a lightweight, signed, structured format served from `.well-known/`.

Each feed lets your domain declare:

- ✅ What your service does  
- 🧠 What prompts, actions, or APIs it exposes  
- 🔐 What’s trusted, signed, or certified  
- 🔁 How agents should behave (scope, fallback, expectations)

Think of it as `robots.txt` for meaning,  
or `schema.org` — but inspectable, signed, and agent-native.

---

## 💼 Why it matters

LLMs are entering every interface —  
but they still guess what your site is about.

This changes that.

- 🧭 Improves discoverability of APIs, tools, and services  
- 🛡️ Enables certified context capsules  
- 📦 Lets agents reuse, replay, or route sessions  
- 🔄 Creates a semantic layer between websites and assistants  
- 🧩 Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, open-source LLMs...

The web gave us `HTML`.  
The mobile era gave us `manifests`.  
The agent era needs **`intent`** — and a format to trust it.

**This is not a plugin. Not a wrapper. Not a lock-in.**  
It’s an open grammar for agents and humans to align.

We’re not adding noise.  
We’re adding **signal**.
