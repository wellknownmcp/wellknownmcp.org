  Apple’s entry into AI-driven agents could reshape the emerging Agentic Web
  landscape. What does it mean for standards like llmfeed mcp?

# Apple Intelligence: A New Player in the Agentic Web?

At WWDC 2025, Apple made waves with its announcement of *Apple Intelligence* — a suite of AI-driven features deeply integrated into iOS, macOS, and visionOS. Beyond the usual privacy-first positioning, one detail caught the attention of those following the evolution of the Agentic Web: Apple’s intent to empower *agent-like behaviors* across its ecosystem.

**Why is this important?** Because the Agentic Web isn’t just about LLMs generating text — it’s about autonomous agents interacting with web services, APIs, and other agents. Apple’s move signals that even a traditionally closed ecosystem sees value in this emerging architecture.

## What role for open standards?

The big question is: will Apple adopt or align with *open standards* like [llmdfee](https://wellknownmcp.org), which define how agents can safely discover, trust, and interact with services on the web? Or will we see yet another proprietary silo?

While Apple hasn’t announced support for `.well-known/` MCP feeds, several signals suggest they are aware of these developments:
- Early documentation references “agent-discoverable” metadata.
- Apple has historically adopted `.well-known/` standards when they align with privacy and control goals.

## What it means for the ecosystem

If Apple embraces even partial compatibility with MCP or similar standards, it could:
- Greatly accelerate adoption of **agent-friendly web patterns**.
- Pressure other closed ecosystems to interoperate.
- Validate the importance of *trustable, verifiable interactions* between agents.

## Our take

The Agentic Web will thrive only if major players like Apple adopt open, interoperable approaches. Proprietary agents locked into single ecosystems would fragment the space and limit innovation.

At [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org), we continue to advocate for a **neutral, certifiable, and open Agentic Web** — one where Apple’s agents, or anyone else’s, can interact safely and verifiably with the broader web.

**Next steps:** We’ll closely watch WWDC follow-ups and developer beta releases for signs of MCP-aligned features. Stay tuned!
