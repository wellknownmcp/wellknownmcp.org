# ðŸ§± The Building Blocks of a Feed

Every `.llmfeed.json` file is made of **structured blocks**. Here's how to understand and use them:

## ðŸ”¹ `feed_type`

Declares the purpose (`prompt`, `export`, `session`, `mobile-app`, `mcp`, etc.)

## ðŸ”¹ `metadata`

Includes origin, description, title, tags, content_type...

## ðŸ”¹ `trust`

Tells the agent what is signed, who signed it, what the trust scope is.

## ðŸ”¹ `signature`

Cryptographic proof using Ed25519 â€” protects the signed_blocks only.

## ðŸ”¹ `certification`

Optional â€” adds third-party confirmation (e.g., by `llmca.org`), and a signature hash.

Start small. You can build your feed one block at a time.  
And use agents or tools to help validate it.
