# From Chatbots to Autonomous Agents: The Web’s Next Evolution

For years, the term **chatbot** dominated conversations about AI on the web.
Now, a more ambitious concept is taking center stage: **autonomous agents**.

Unlike simple chatbots, autonomous agents can:
- Set and pursue goals.
- Reason about their environment.
- Interact with diverse services and APIs.
- Collaborate with other agents.

This shift is driving the emergence of the **Agentic Web** — and raising new challenges for web architecture.

## What’s driving the change?

Several trends are converging:
- **LLM-powered reasoning** has dramatically improved.
- **Tool-use frameworks** (like OpenAI’s Functions, LangChain, AutoGPT) enable complex workflows.
- **Agent frameworks** (CrewAI, Autogen, Meta’s Open Agents) are maturing.
- Businesses want **goal-oriented AI**, not just chat.

The result: agents that navigate and act on the web — autonomously.

## Why standards matter

Without open standards, the Agentic Web risks becoming:
- **Opaque**: agents doing things no one can audit.
- **Fragmented**: each ecosystem using its own proprietary protocols.
- **Unsafe**: agents interacting in ways that violate trust or intent.

This is where **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** comes in:
- Provides a **transparent, verifiable interface** for agent-service interactions.
- Uses signed `.well-known/mcp.llmfeed.json` feeds.
- Exposes **capabilities, trust models, and interaction guidelines**.

## From chatbots to agents — new requirements

| Feature | Chatbots | Autonomous Agents |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Interaction scope | Text Q&A | Multi-step, goal-driven |
| Web integration | Limited scraping | Structured API / service use |
| Trust handling | Ad hoc | Explicit, auditable |
| Standards needed | Minimal | High (like MCP) |

As we move from chatbots to agents, **MCP becomes essential**.

## Our take

The future of the web is **agentic**.
But it must be:
- **Transparent** — so users and services understand what’s happening.
- **Trustable** — with auditable interactions.
- **Open** — so no single actor dominates the space.

At [wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org), we are committed to building this foundation — and invite all Agentic Web stakeholders to contribute.

**Next steps:** We’ll continue driving adoption of MCP in **agent frameworks** — so the next generation of web agents interacts **responsibly and openly**.
