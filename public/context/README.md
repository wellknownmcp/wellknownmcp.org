# ðŸ“š Context Definitions â€“ WellKnownMCP

This folder contains semantic context definitions for the WellKnownMCP standard and its associated feeds.

## Current Version

- **v1**: [context/v1](https://wellknownmcp.org/context/v1)

This version provides JSON-LD-compatible mappings for key fields used in `.well-known/` resources, `.llmfeed.json` exports, and MCP endpoints.

The context ensures that LLMs and autonomous agents can properly interpret feed fields such as `origin`, `feeds`, `audience`, `trust_level`, `scope`, `description`, `keywords`, and `capabilities`.
