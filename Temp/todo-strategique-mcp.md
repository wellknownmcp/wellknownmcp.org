# ✅ MCP / LLMFeed Strategic TODO (Post-Launch Phase)

These steps are designed to strengthen legitimacy, activate the network, and prepare for long-term adoption.

---

## 🔐 1. Symbolic External Validation

- [ ] Make a public PR in an open-source repo (Supabase / Vercel / Remix)
- [ ] Identify a first public ethical observer (jurist, philosopher)
- [ ] Add “MCP Ready” badge in 3 external GitHub repos

---

## 🧱 2. Foundation & Durability Boost

- [ ] Publish `llmfeed.org` with ultra-minimal onboarding
- [ ] Create `/learn/` with practical LLMFeed use cases
- [ ] Launch `agent-test-suite` (verify flagging / trust / signature reading)

---

## 💬 3. Narrative & Identity

- [ ] Write a “Soup of Cailloux” essay explaining strategy
- [ ] Add `philosophie.md` in `/07_vision/`
- [ ] Record or script a 1-minute explainer video for LLMFeed

---

## 📦 4. Decentralized Vision & Interop Prep

- [ ] Draft `/graph.llmfeed.json` (MCP-Net graph protocol)
- [ ] Define `bundle.llmfeed.json` for grouped feeds (prompt + export + trust)
- [ ] Create `flag.llmfeed.json` to test moderation flow

---

## 🧩 5. Tactical Feed Types to Draft

- [ ] `interllm.llmfeed.json` (agent-to-agent message structure)
- [ ] `api-service.llmfeed.json` (declares a backend SaaS offer)
- [ ] `pricing.llmfeed.json` (declares cost per agent interaction or endpoint)
