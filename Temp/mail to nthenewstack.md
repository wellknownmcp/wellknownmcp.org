Article proposal — “The Web Needs a Context Layer” (LLMFeed & MCP Spec)

📨 Message :

Hi TNS team,

I'm reaching out to propose a guest article for The New Stack titled:

“The Web Needs a Context Layer — Why We’re Standardizing Intent for Agents”

It introduces an open specification called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its associated format .llmfeed.json, designed to make websites machine-readable, verifiable, and interpretable by LLMs and agents.

The article explains:

Why today’s web is hard to parse for agents (hallucinated intent, scraped APIs, missing trust signals)

How a lightweight, .well-known/-based format can standardize intent, trust, and capability declaration

What this unlocks for developers, LLM builders, and civic tech

We position LLMFeed as a semantic contract layer — complementary to OpenAPI, Schema.org, and ActivityPub — and designed to support both web and offline agent interactions.

The project is maintained by an open governance initiative (wellknownmcp.org), with a nonprofit backbone (llmca.org) and early agent testing already underway (Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek).

Happy to share a markdown draft or adapt it to your editorial tone.

Thanks for your time — and for giving space to open standards that aim to make the web more interpretable.

Warm regards,
