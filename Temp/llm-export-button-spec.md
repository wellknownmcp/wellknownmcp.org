# ExportToLLM Button â€“ Full Specification

The `ExportToLLM` button allows exporting content as `.llmfeed.json`.
It supports 3 modes: contextual (current page), combined (pages by tags), dynamic-static (predefined recipe).

UX: button remains identical for human user. Only surrounding context explains the intent.
